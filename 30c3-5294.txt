how we got into this project in the first place
we had a production run, we were using MicroSD cards, as the remoable media for 
and compared them, and noted down certain anomalies
hey guys, these cards are not seeming to be consistent 
no, no, no, no, these are totally authentic cards
we put acid on them, reveal the insides
at which point, they come back and say we'll take the fake cards and give you the real cards

But this is only archiveable if you have a huge amount
these guys have to sell all (huge amount) ift they wont loose money.
they supposted to make 16gb fcards with only 2 gb good space
the lates generation TLS are good enough for 100k cycles
