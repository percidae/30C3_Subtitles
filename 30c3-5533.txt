I should add we did another study of ipmi devices where the motherboard has an embedded arm device you can get into the server to powercycle the server and do kvm. 
It's basicly a backdoor and we looked at the implementations and it was riddled with security flaws. 
Anyway using zmap we found out to find 52hundred thousand servers with these vulnerabilities. 
So one experiment was looking for Tor bridges. Using a very simple application of zmap we identified more than 86% of Tor bridges. 
Detecting Service Disruptions. What happened was in my country a storm called sandy. Using internet wide scanning we could find power outages while this storm was going on. Places where the power went out the routers of the people couldnt expose their webinterface to the world. 
This has to do with cryptography. Using basicly the prototype of zmap. In order to collect the public keys. We could do a health check for the state of cryptography in the internet. 
There is a very large amount of duplicate keys on a lot of systems. 
Things like default certificates or bad random number generators. It's evidence for a really huge problem. 
Some keys are not only duplicates in ways that would let you figure out what the private key is. 
In RSA you have the private key p and q. If there was a problem with your random number generator even with different public keys you could simply get the private key. 
We could get the private keys of half a percent of all the priate keys of all the TLS hosts on the internet. For SSH we got more than 1 percent. 
If we actually look at the certificates. 
Turns out all of these devices are embedded systems. 


Welcome to the Subtitles Pad, nice to see you here! 
  
This pad text gets synchronized while typing, so that every person looking at this page will see the same text in realtime. This enables you to collaborate on the transcription of the spoken words! 
 
 It is also possible to change the main writer during the talk when fingers become tired.
  
Please recrute as many participants as you can. That way, we will create the best possible draft together which is later on used for setting the subtitles.
  
Thank you very, very much for your help!

Willkommen auf dem Untertitel-Pad, schön dich hier zu sehen! 
  
Dieses Pad synchronisiert sich sofort, wenn du etwas tippst. Jeder, der diese Seite ansieht, sieht den gleichen Text wie du. Auf diesem Weg kann nahtlos aus dem gesprochenen Wort eines Vortrags geschriebene Sprache werden. 
  
Der Haupt-Mitschreiber kann so während des Vortrages ganz einfach abgelöst werden, wenn z.B. die Finger müde und die richtigen Tasten nicht mehr getroffen werden.
  
Bitte versuche so viele Mitschreiber oder Kontrolleure wie möglich zu finden, um einen möglichst guten ersten Entwurf für das spätere Untertiteln zu erstellen. 
  
Vielen, vielen Dank für deine Mithilfe!
