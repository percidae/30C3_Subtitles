1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,710
Jacob Appelbaum: So, thanks very much to the
guy who brought me a Mate.

2
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,530
I learned his name is Alexander.

3
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,359
It's never a good idea to take drugs from
strangers,

4
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,230
so I introduced myself before I drank it - thank
you.

5
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,730
First I wanted to say that following up after
Glenn Greenwald is a great honor and a really

6
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,470
difficult thing to do, that's a really tough
act to follow, and he's pretty much one of,

7
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,290
I think, our heroes.

8
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,909
So, it's really great to be able to share
the stage with him, even for just a brief

9
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,670
moment. And I wanted to do something a little
unconventional when we started and Roger agreed.

10
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,380
Which is that we want people who have questions
- since I suspect some things happened this

11
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,469
year that arouse a lot of questions in people
- we'd like you to write those questions down,

12
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,770
pass them to an Angel or to just bring them
to the front of the stage as soon as possible

13
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,390
during the talk, so that we can answer as
many of your questions as is possible.

14
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,039
This is a lot of stuff that happened, there's
a lot of confusion, and we wanna make sure

15
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:53,880
that people feel like we are actually answering
those questions in a useful way.

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,070
And if you wanna do that, it'd be great, and
otherwise, we're gonna try to have the second

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,969
half of our talk be mostly space for questioning.

18
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,229
So with that, here is Roger.

19
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,520
Roger Dingledine: Okay, so, a lot of things
have happened over this past year,

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,229
and we're gonna try and cover as many of them
as we can.

21
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,560
Here's a great quote from either NSA or GCHQ,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm actually not sure which one it is.

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,190
But we're gonna start a little bit earlier
in the process than this and work our way

24
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,960
up to that.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,300
So, we're in a war, or rather, conflict of
perception here. There are a lot - I mean,

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,900
you saw Glenn's talk earlier - there are a
lot of large media organisations out there

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,360
that are trying to present Tor in lots of
different ways,

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,720
and we all here understand the value that
Tor provides to the world, but there are a

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,170
growing number of people around the world
who are learning about Tor not from our website,

30
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,750
or from seeing one of these talks or from
learning it from somebody who uses it and

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,150
teaches them how to use it.

32
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,540
But they read the Time Magazine or Economist
or whatever the mainstream newspapers are,

33
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,790
and part of our challenge is how do we help
you, and help the rest of the world do outreach

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,650
and education, so that people can understand
what Tor is for and how it works and what

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,700
sorts of people actually use it.

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,650
So, for example, GCHQ has been given instructions
to try to kill Tor by, I mean, who knows,

37
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,980
maybe they thought of it on their own, maybe
we can imagine some nearby governments asked

38
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,950
them to do it. And part of the challenge...
they say "we have to kill it because of child

39
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,770
porn".

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,810
And it turns out that we actually do know
that some people around the world are using

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,810
Tor for child porn. For example, we have talked
to a lot of federal agencies who use Tor to

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,410
fetch child porn. [subdued laughter]

43
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,730
I talked to people in the FBI who use Tor
every day to safely reach the websites that

44
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,510
they want to investigate.

45
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,980
The most crazy example of this is actually
the Internet Watch Foundation. How many people

46
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,700
here have heard of the Internet Watch Foundation?
I see a very small number of hands.

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,500
They are the censorship wing of the British
government. They are the sort of quasi-government

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,390
organisation who is tasked with coming up
with the blacklist for the internet for England.

49
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,660
And, we got e-mail from them a few years ago,
saying - not what you'd expect, you'd expect

50
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,330
"Hey, can you please shut this thing down,
can you turn it off, it's a big hassle for

51
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,590
us." - the question they asked me was: "How
can we make Tor faster?" [laughter, claps]

52
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,930
It turns out that they need Tor, because people
report URLs to them, they need to fetch them

53
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,840
somehow. It turns out that when you go the
URL with the allegedly bad stuff on it and

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,250
you're coming from the Internet Watch Foundation's
IP-address, they give you kittens. [laughter]

55
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,909
Who would have known? [laughter, applause]

56
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:46,150
So it turns out that these censors need an
anonymity system in order to censor their

57
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,740
internet. [laughter] Fun times.

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,780
So another challenge here: at the same point,
one of my side hobbies is teaching law enforcement

59
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,139
how the internet works, and how security works
and how Tor works.

60
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,759
So, yeah, their job does suck, but it's actually
not our fault that their job sucks. There

61
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,219
are a lot of different challenges to successfully
being a good, honest law enforcement person

62
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:12,900
these days.

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,930
So, for example, I went to Amsterdam and Brussels
in January of this past year to try to teach

64
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,979
various law enforcement groups.

65
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,050
And I ended up having a four-hour debate with
the Dutch regional police, and then another

66
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,330
four-hour debate with a Belgian cybercrime
unit and then another four-hour debate with

67
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,830
the Dutch national police.

68
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,460
And, there are a lot of good-meaning smart
people in each of these organisations, but

69
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,259
they end up, as a group, doing sometimes quite
bad things.

70
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,030
So part of our challenge is: how do we teach
them that Tor is not the enemy for them?

71
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,810
And there are a couple of stories that I've
been trying to refine using on them. One of

72
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,090
them they always pull out, the "But what about
child porn? What about bad people? What about

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,129
some creep using Tor to do bad things?".

74
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,009
And one of the arguments that I tried on them
was, “Okay, so on the one hand we have a

75
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:11,270
girl in Syria who is alive right now because
of Tor. Because her family was able to communicate

76
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,349
safely and the Syrian military didn’t break
in and murder all of them."

77
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,800
"On the other hand, we have a girl in America
who is getting hassled by some creep on the

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,180
internet who is stalking her over Tor."

79
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,749
So the question is, how do we balance, how
do we value these things? How do we assign

80
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:33,729
a value to the girl in Syria and how do we
assign a value to the girl in America so that

81
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,560
we can decide which one of these is more important?

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,479
And actually the answer is, you don’t get
to make that choice, that’s not the right

83
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,120
question to ask.

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,930
Because if we take Tor away from the girl
in Syria, she’s going to die. If we take

85
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,650
Tor away from the creep in America, he’s
got a lot of other options for how he can

86
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,620
be a creep and start stalking people.

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,479
So if you’re a bad person, for various definitions
of bad person, and you’re willing to break

88
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,539
laws or go around social norms, you’ve got
a lot of other options besides what Tor provides.

89
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:10,539
Whereas there are very few tools out there
like Tor for honest, I'd like to say law-abiding,

90
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:16,249
but let's go with civilization-abiding citizens
out there.

91
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:23,249
Jacob Appelbaum: And it’s important to understand
that this hypothetical thing is actually also

92
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,840
true for certain values.

93
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,779
So at our Tor developer meeting that we had
in Munich recently, that Syrian woman came

94
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,860
to us, and thanked us for Tor. She said,

95
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,009
I’m from a city called Homs. You might have
heard about it, it’s not a city anymore.

96
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,270
I used Tor. My family used Tor. We were able
to keep ourselves safe on the internet thanks

97
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,129
to Tor.

98
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,039
So I wanted to come here to Munich to tell
you this. Thank you for the work that you’re

99
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,409
doing.

100
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,900
And for people who - this was their first
dev meeting - they were completely blown away

101
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,150
to meet this person.

102
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,129
- 'Wow, the stuff that we're working on, it
really does matter, there are real people

103
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:01,779
behind it.'

104
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:06,520
And, I think, we were all really touched by
it, and all of us know someone who has been

105
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,449
on the receiving end of people being jerks
on the internet.

106
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,249
So this is a real thing where there are real
people involved, and it's really important

107
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,389
to understand that if you remove the option
for that woman in Syria

108
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,210
- or you here in Germany, now that we know
what Edward Snowden has told the world -

109
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,949
those bad guys, those jerks, for different
values of that,

110
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:28,419
they always have options.

111
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,919
But very rarely do all of us have options
that will actually keep us safe.

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,130
And Tor is certainly not the only one, but
right now, and we hope in this talk you'll

113
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,120
see that we're making the right tradeoff by
working on Tor.

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,650
[Roger Dingledine]
One of the other talks that I give to them,

115
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,130
one of the other stories that I give to them,

116
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,760
one of the big questions they always ask me
is: "But what about terrorists? Aren't you

117
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,530
helping terrorists?"

118
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,480
And we, we can and we should talk about "What
do you mean by terrorists?" because in China

119
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,700
they have a very different definition of terrorists
and in Ghaza they have a very different definition

120
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,450
of terrorists,

121
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,700
and in America, they are always thinking of
a small number of people in some Middle-Eastern

122
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,880
country who are trying to blow up buildings
or something -

123
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,490
[Jacob Appelbaum]
Mohamed Badguy, I think is his name.

124
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,460
[Roger Dingledine]
Yes, that -

125
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,720
[Jacob Appelbaum]
In the NSA slides.

126
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,910
[Roger Dingledine]
Yes.

127
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,720
So, scenario one: I want to build a tool that
works for millions of people, it will work

128
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,670
for the next year, and I can tell you how
it works, so you can help me evaluate it.

129
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,710
That's Tor's problem.

130
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,770
Scenario two: I want to build a tool that
will work for the next two weeks, it will

131
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,340
work for 20 people and I'm not going to tell
you about it.

132
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,090
There are so many more ways of solving scenario
two than solving scenario one.

133
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:48,200
The bad guys for all sorts of definitions,
the bad guys have a lot more options on how

134
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,790
they can keep safe. They don't have to scale,
it doesn't have to last forever, they don't

135
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,470
want peer review, they don't want anybody
to even know that it's happening.

136
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,430
So the challenge that Tor has is that we wanna
build something that works for everybody and

137
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,080
that everybody can analyze and learn about.
That's a much harder problem, there are far

138
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,370
fewer ways of solving that.

139
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,580
So, the terrorists, they got a lot of options.
That sucks. We need to build tools that can

140
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,230
keep the rest of the world save.

141
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,660
[Jacob Appelbaum]
And it's important, really, to try to have

142
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,240
some good rethorical arguments, I think. I
mean, we sort of put a few facts up here.

143
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,330
One interesting point to mention is that people
who really don't want anonymity to exist in

144
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,700
a practical sense, maybe not even in a theoretical,
human rights sense either, but definitely

145
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,570
in a practical sense, they're not really having
honest conversations about it.

146
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,630
For example, this DOJ study, the Department
of Justice in the United States, they actually

147
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,270
started to do a study where they classified
traffic leaving Tor exit nodes.

148
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,580
Which is interesting - that they were basically
probably wiretapping an exit node to do that

149
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,560
study, I wonder how they went about that - but
nonetheless, they came up with the number

150
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,830
of three percent of the traffic being bad
and then they aborted the study because they

151
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,730
received many DMCA takedown notices. [laughter]

152
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,780
[Roger Dingledine]
Yes, they -

153
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,740
[Jacob Appelbaum]
Apparently even the DMCA is a problem to finding

154
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,470
out answers. [unintelligible]

155
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,110
[Roger Dingledine, interrupts]
They asked a university to run the Tor exit

156
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,380
for them and they were just starting out doing
their study, and then the university started

157
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,880
getting DMCA takedowns and said:

158
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,270
"Well, we have to stop, the lawyers told us
to stop!", and the Department of Justice said:

159
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,410
"We're the Department of Justice, keep doing
it.", and then they turned it off. [laughter]

160
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,490
So, not sure how the balance of power goes
there, but the initial results they were looking

161
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:31,330
towards were about three percent of the traffic
coming out of that Tor exit node was bad,

162
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,910
but I haven't figured out what they mean by
"bad". But I'll take it if it's three percent.

163
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,730
[Jacob Appelbaum]

164
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:48,730
Jake dislikes the term 'war' when talking
about the internet. The BBC has articles on

165
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:03,850
their website on using Tor + Silk Road to
buy drugs. We don't do that - even though

166
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,020
Bitcoin is amazing, it's not anonymous. BBC
has a 'man-bite-dog'-approach, they run with

167
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,400
everything which looks a bit interesting.
We dont wan tthat: we want for every person

168
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,320
to have the right and possiblity to express
themselves. When the BBC ran a story about

169
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,960
Tor, everyone was thankful, then they posted
another article on Tor+Silk Road.

170
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,260
That has a serious problem, the war on drugs
becomes intertwined with the war on Tor. Agent

171
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,560
who showed 'massive drop ' in Tor traffic
after Silk Road shut down, was with US govt.

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,750
Such publicty always leads to drop, not necessarily
directly connected. Then they checked the

173
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,990
data, see graph, and saw almost no drop. Can
you guess where the drop the agent talks about

174
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,810
occurred? It didn't go down by 50%. Agent
waswrong. Qrrow where it would have dropped

175
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,640
according to agent. Here's a graph of the
overall network growth over the past three

176
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,950
years. Multiple relays added after Snowden
revelations.

177
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,120
The Dark Web (or other scary names) is media
trying to produce as many articles as they

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,100
can. Definitions range from 'every webpage
that Google can't index' (so every govt database,

179
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,190
etc), '98% of pages are in dark web', 'only
way to access dark web is through Tor'. These

180
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,420
statements together sell many articles, people
are shocked.

181
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,920
REality is that it's not actually the case.
People here know this: these stories are clickbait'.

182
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,020
Few hands go up about Tor hidden se
(lost connection for a minute)

183
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,160
These things also bring out much negative
attention. The Freedom Hosting was relentlessly

184
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,160
attacked, because the topics the other sites
have pull on peoples' hearts in a big way.

185
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,630
First issue of WikiLeaks was really hard on
many people. The news also picks up on that

186
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,350
in negative ways. You could call that a cultural
conflict.

187
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,640
I heard from a DEA person who was involved
in Farmer's Market takedown. Old drug webiste,

188
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,570
Tor was not involved. DEA wanted to take it
down. They sent a letter to take it down,

189
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,650
[...]
People used hushmail. Year or two later people

190
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,300
discovered Tor. SIx months later there were
all these newspaper articles about how Tor

191
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,900
hidden services are broken. They were using
PayPal directly. Story is 'don 't use Hushmail'.

192
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,620
Don't use lawful interception-compliant or
backdoored services, such as Hushmail, especially

193
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,610
if you traffic drugs.

194
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,950
As a result, we have seen some pretty crazy
stuff happen. In this case, this year we saw

195
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,900
one of the most intersting exploits we have
seen deployed againts a broad scale of users.

196
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,710
Not sure who was behind it. Claimed by an
FBI agent, IP space may be NSA-owned. Exploit

197
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,050
in Firefox. Traditionally, if you don't use
Tor, they go to your house and install gear

198
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,120
or intercept your connection. They find out
who you are, target you, serve you an exploit.

199
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,540
Here, they had taken over a Tor hidden service
and explited old versions of Tor browser.

200
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,750
Not used as fresh zero-day. When the FBI did
this, they give this exploit to other regimes

201
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,780
as well. They would like to be able to be
more up to speed with Firefox. HOwever, there

202
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,560
is still desynchronisation. They have probably
hired some people from this community - fuck

203
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,440
you- and have them write their exploits.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Now we're looking into Chrome, which has a
differen t and sometimes more secure architecture.

205
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,130
We're hoping to work on using Chrome, anyone
want to help? Please do.

206
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,940
Diversity of funding - a lot of funding comes
from governmetns. There are ten things we

207
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,720
want to work on, if you want to fund one of
those ten, you can focus our interests. Government

208
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,280
funding helps to do many cool things. people
can be payed to work on Tor, on the other

209
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,270
hand governments can influence our priorities.
We will not put backdoors in Tor.

210
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,770
People have approached us to put backdoors
in Tor. It is a serious committment to not

211
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,770
do this. We fix everything as soon as we find
out that something is wrong. There are people

212
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:31,590
who have tried to have us change that committment.
When we say we are non-profit, they are dumbfounded.

213
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:44,690
US DoJ person approached, Congress has given
us right to backdoor everything, you have

214
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,680
to make a backdoor so that we can use our
rights to surveil everybody. You abuse the

215
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,120
righst you have been given by our country.
Then they said they are nonprofit and the

216
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,100
conversation bascially ended. Part of what
they need to do: continue to make safe tools.

217
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,360
Everyone wants to help for anti-censorship,
noone wants to pay for better anonimyt. People

218
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,360
are often dependent on the anonimity Tor allows.
There is a tradeoff with a lot of our founders,

219
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:21,670
they don't like us as much when we say really
outrageaous thiings. We want funders who want

220
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,390
the same things as you and us: if you know
someone, please approach us.

221
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:33,390
It's easy to say we should not be political.
It's also crazy to say so, because the idea

222
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,550
of haveing free speech and freedom of information
is a very political idea. Especillay after

223
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,970
the summer of Snowden, we realize almost no
tools can resist NSA/GCHQ. They can't get

224
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,930
all Tor users, we made it very expensive for
them to do mass surveillance. Please note

225
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,300
that the solution is not partisan: all people
are equally good or bad. The common good of

226
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,060
every one having these rights protected is
an important thing to build and to have. That

227
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,060
is the best kind of political solution we
can have. We however need

228
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:09,709
[...]

229
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:16,459
We need everyone in the same network, diversity
of users. From a technical perspective, so

230
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:23,919
that they can keep each other safe. We all
get better when the others are involved. Having

231
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:32,179
Jake talk to LE is not the most effective
way. Lawyer said "Never miss a chance to shut

232
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,450
the fuck up". Therefore we instruct everybody:
corporations, civil righst groups, LE. We

233
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,659
need you to be involved and share the word
in your co

234
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,460
[...]
We're pretty good in fighting back against

235
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,460
policies and legal changes. If ISPs hate exit
relays, it becomes harder to run one. We're

236
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,259
doing ok in that respect. Third one we have
not focused on as much as we could. Growing

237
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:57,179
number of places are just rejecting Tor users.
Wikipedia, Skype. Microsoft hangs up on you

238
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,629
if you want to Skype, because of blacklist
from some company, they blakclist Tor exit

239
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:08,629
relays. We need help learning how to teach
all these companies to not judge users on

240
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,309
their IP adresses.

241
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:17,309
When a company does not want to give you location
anonimity, maybe there's a reason for that.

242
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:24,999
OFten they don't have metrics for not having
location data. In a few cases it's better

243
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,879
that Tor is blocked, because they don't allow
anonymous logins when Tor is allowed. We need

244
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:36,200
to show that it is the best thing right now.
We need people to help us understand the overlap

245
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,769
between the Tor community and their community
(especially Wikipedia). If Iḿ not abusive

246
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,100
on Wikipedia, I should be able to login anonymously.
Especially since the only way to anonymously

247
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,659
use wikipedia is through Tor.

248
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,009
The last point is this one (graph). People
started yelling 'IPO'. Aparrently, some person

249
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,679
signed up his entire botnet. It's good to
know scalability measures work. We had to

250
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,970
make some changes. Using elliptic curves as
really helped to lower work on the relasy.

251
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,649
If this had been a real attacker against the
Tor network, it probably would have been fatal.

252
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:12,620
Microsoft has the power to remove the things
they think are malicious. Tor clients on these

253
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,340
bots are often still installed. Botnet happening
in same time as Snowden revelations makes

254
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:25,340
it hard to assess the impact of these revelations
on Tor use. Bots connecting are a really serious

255
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,990
threat to the Tor network.

256
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,559
It would make it significantly harder to damage
the Tor network if more people were involved.

257
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,779
When talking of funding for better anonimity,
how much do you need? If you're wiilling to

258
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:46,460
fund it, it wuold be great if you could match
what government funders bring to the table.

259
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,230
Or as much money as you have, both are great.
If it ends up on the 2 million USD we have

260
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,799
no money for extras. We have to build all
sorts of tools that are not directly related

261
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,320
to Tor. It's not enough to have Tor, hyou
need tools to work with Tor. We haven't really

262
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,269
experimented with that.

263
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,230
The NSA and GCHQ have decided that they don't
like anonimity and want to eradicate it. A

264
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,200
few exceptions. I will talk about this on
monday. On the Tor side, Quick Ant is a [...]. It

265
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,360
is recording data about TLS sessions, pulled
from a larger pile that is called FLYINGPIG.

266
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,399
That program is kind of scary, but not too
much. Quantum INsert is a scary man on the

267
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:27,049
side attack. FOXACID is a targeted attack,
sort of awatering hole attack. When you use

268
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,820
Tor they make your server redirect to their
malicious code and hit you. It took them eight

269
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,119
months to hit one Tor user. That's great.
It really takes much effort to hit one person,

270
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,850
they need that person to be caught.

271
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,740
Quantom Cookie is a program to retrieve other
browser connections to find out concurrent

272
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,740
browser activity. Then they would insert other
things the browser would request to see what

273
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,299
other activity you have. Solution is HTTPS
EVerywhere, whihc also allows session isolation.

274
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,570
On the other hand, not every website allows
TLS. The thing that makes it interseting is

275
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,679
that they do it at internet scale.

276
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,039
You would imaginge that not routing through
Five Eyes countries makes you safer. On the

277
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,929
other hand, in the Five Eyes countries you
have some protections. The key point to take

278
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,169
home is that every single person here has
the same problems if they're not useing Tor.

279
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,710
The story here is they look at Tor traffic
coming out of Tor relays

280
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:22,710
they don't know who it is.
On the one hand, they need borad attacks (not

281
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,299
targeted).

282
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:29,690
DNI sent out a press release that they are
never attacking US citizens. {...]James Platter

283
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,929
is an asshole (:) )

284
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:36,710
I talked to an NSA person a couple of weeks
ago ... You have to attack all non-Americans/

285
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:43,710
No, only if they are the person who we are
attacking. I wish we had 90000 Tor nodes,

286
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:03,259
that would be incredible. When the NSA ran
tor notdes, that was about a dozen.

287
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:10,259
They can watch your Tor relays, which is as
good as having their own relay. We should

288
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,460
not be worried they're runnning relays. It's
a concern, but the bigger concern is that

289
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:25,460
they're watching the whole internet. The problem
is not 

290
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,440
so much are they running relays but how many
normal relays can they watch. A large adversary

291
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,720
like the NSA: a third? Half/ We don't know.

292
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:28,529
Who here uses a VPN or some kind of VPN service
[about 1/4]? This is a big problem, the hide-my-ass

293
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:01,230
problem. They basically promote their service
for revolution in Egupt, but turn around when

294
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,249
aimed at the UK.
We need to build decentralized systems

295
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:14,249
In some cases we know that VPN proxies have
data retion for 10-15 year, that 's bad news.

296
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,019
The news on VPNs is not in your favor.

297
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,989
What happens with this stuff?

298
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:25,909
It could be that the silk road fellow used
VPN.

299
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:32,909
It could also be that the NSA has tracked
him in some other way.

300
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:45,100
Parallel construction is a really serious
problem,

301
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:52,100
if we could expand Tor network, we would make
it significantly harder to do that.

302
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:04,269
We live in a world were intelligence services
and LE are merging together.

303
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,970
That is a sierious problem for Tor.

304
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,110
NSA is doing bad stuff, why should that affect
FBI?

305
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:21,110
They said they told the FBI. Do they anonymously
tip the FBI?

306
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:33,999
Is there a third party anonymous whistleblower?

307
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:46,769
From the FBI point of view, thats basically
the same.

308
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:53,769
We are able to adress some questions.

309
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Summaries: We want to improve hidden services.

310
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:50,019
We want to make them strong, especially improve
performance.

311
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:59,739
The 
more mainstream they become, the more use
we will be seeing.

312
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,409
It should be esay to use them.

313
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:22,409
The most important things for cypherpunks
to understand.

314
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,769
If you like, use Bitcoin.

315
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:37,769
If you want to give us lots of BItocins, do
not get dsicouraged.

316
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:55,940
In Noisy Square, there is 

317
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:33,629
now 

318
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:04,049
a talk on helping Tor.

319
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:11,710
We need you 

320
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:30,669
to 

321
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:55,629
teach other poeple on 

322
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:35,659
why Tor 

323
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:58,899
is important.

324
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:06,970
Thank you

325
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:15,169
