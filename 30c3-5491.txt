No burning wor

We'd like you to take a couple things away from this talk.  A piece from technology or society is rarely settled in just a few years.  Just in the past few years we dont really know what using email means.  We have a reasonable idea about how to use an auditorium.  The other thing we'd like to talk about is geek culture.  It is now at the heart of social and () movements. It used to be apolitical but every code your write and action you take has poltical and other changes.  This is a change that has happened in our life times.

Quinn is mostly a incoherent blend of ..... (very fast)   '

Its about examing the network of effect that 


not what abou Ella or


livewith now
becausefundamentallyyy architecture has a politics and has a culture
we were kind of sitting around

kind of beeing outsiders. the world pivoted and put us on the

do politically what we

around the worldd right now

one of the really interesting structures: states
they got a couple of basic things the req
need to see their territory 
aanything to anytime
if you cant percieve a thing you cant interact with it
understandable to the state 
the notion 
it sohuld be able to understand the city from which ti governs

actual city of brazlia
reality has kind of come back in a lot of messier
ability of the state terrain is actually a good thing
around particular 
when they didnt understant that cholera was spread thru water
map told us things about human desease transmission which saved us hundreds of milltions of lives

censud record of where all the jews were for the nazis

the revolutionary government napoleon standardized on the etric syystem

incompatible basic unit systems

it also laid the groundwork for tax standardization
you know if someone was using the metrics system
they worked for the government
in the state of quinn? [no relation ]the emperor decided that imposing surnames on the population was good ide
ti ta
apply laws to families
many of the rling families already ahd surnames
common people had all sorts of ways to be known
dozen diffenrent way to be named
this is very very convenient for you
way of changing the owner structure
head of the family responsible for the rest of the family
really interesting because it show that the vision of the state has consequences

networks weird legibility

surveillance is what we do when we care about something, somtimes that care takes positive forms, sometimes it allows to buld infrastrufture, sometimes to fee, sometimes for  fcontroor political controll 
neither good or bad nor neutral, survelience is when we check up on each other. 
finding a way to recalmin the positive than to fight the negative is task

the new cycle we have right now if we want to take it back to 
this makes more sense , they trying to make their world more legible?

destroying by ignoring the ones 
history gives you a matter of perspection
they want to tap people for good and bad reasons
power to mold the country they're in
this can be a most progressively and destructively

i say: a state will always spy as much as it can [for good and bad]
we're in an odd time of history

Tindale wanted to translate the bible into English, centuries before this pope innocence the 3rd had sentenced to death people who had tried to do this
church were the people who had the knowledge to understand it. top down movement

saint Thomas Moore belief church was ... to keep order. If this sounds Hobbsian , it is. This is a debate we have been having for along time. 
Moore and Tindale got in a huge fight, big argument, which spanned the continent, whether or not the Bible should be in English
Martin Luther thesis on the door and sent them around the continent.

The statement Tindale ran away and 

In this case the communiation tehnology was the printing press.

I'll stay here in Germany,
The printing press had been a huge too of the church, they had been the best customers

Legibility on their religion: Make sure everybody had the right ...

then the dissidents found out they can do the same
Printin press going to reform the caholic churhc?
Printing press changed everything on the planet but not the catolic church

Power of guns, power of money and power of god are just three kinds of different power.
Lot of subltlety here on how power acts.

Corporate/state each are the same bad things?

You need your own kind of legibility, your own kind of surveillance.

Rule of law wihle the state ist panicking

how do we deal with this we don't know?
we can't interpret it anymore.

On a personal level, things have gotten weird, too.

Wehn you join a network that network or institution has a set of ethics.
You become
Infrastructure does this, too
Infrastructure has an ethics.
We're dealing with suicidal infrastructure we're embedded ourselves.
Things in our live kan somtimes override ethics. If you have kids .. do anything to feed those kids
We don't just have a single set of ethics.

We're literally fighting ourselves. That is one of the conditions of the next century.

Network we're on makes people weird.

Uncontrollable magic. That's what you have become.

We're kind of living thru this process. No language or infrastructure to describe.
