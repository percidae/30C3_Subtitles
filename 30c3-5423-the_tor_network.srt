1
00:00:09,86 --> 00:00:14,83
so now the next arc that we have here
for one hour from 8:30 till 9:30

2
00:00:14,83 --> 00:00:16,33
as the Tor network

3
00:00:16,33 --> 00:00:20,08
in interesting times I don't know how
many of you are familiar with the words

4
00:00:20,08 --> 00:00:21,2
of Terry Pratchett

5
00:00:21,2 --> 00:00:24,22
but anyways and another tough Terry
Pratt said

6
00:00:24,22 --> 00:00:29,189
there is some the saying and may you
live in interesting times

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,47
that is actually occurs for someone that
u especially dislike because it usually

8
00:00:33,47 --> 00:00:35,129
means that you're in a lot of trouble

9
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:38,519
so I guess who are very excited for this
year's Tour talk

10
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,76
by the everlasting Dream Team Jacob
Appelbaum

11
00:00:41,76 --> 00:00:48,76
and proctor deals I'm there you go the

12
00:00:54,77 --> 00:00:59,01
so on thanks very much to the guy who
brought me Mata had learned his name is

13
00:00:59,01 --> 00:01:02,3
Alexander it's never good idea to take
drugs from strangers to introduce myself

14
00:01:02,3 --> 00:01:03,36
up for a drink it

15
00:01:03,36 --> 00:01:06,43
thank you com

16
00:01:06,43 --> 00:01:10,4
for someone to say that following up
after Glenn Greenwald urs

17
00:01:10,4 --> 00:01:14,04
a great honor and a really difficult
thing to do at a really tough act to

18
00:01:14,04 --> 00:01:14,59
follow

19
00:01:14,59 --> 00:01:18,01
and he's pretty much what I think our
heroes

20
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:21,54
so it's really great to be able to share
the stage with an even for just a brief

21
00:01:21,54 --> 00:01:22,22
moment

22
00:01:22,22 --> 00:01:25,9
and I want to do something a little
unconventional when we started and Roger

23
00:01:25,9 --> 00:01:26,45
greed

24
00:01:26,45 --> 00:01:29,979
which is that we want people who have
questions since I suspect something's

25
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,03
happened this year

26
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:34,81
there as a lot of questions and people
we'd like you to write those questions

27
00:01:34,81 --> 00:01:35,3
down

28
00:01:35,3 --> 00:01:39,92
passed into an angel or to just bring
them to the front of the stage as soon

29
00:01:39,92 --> 00:01:40,71
as possible

30
00:01:40,71 --> 00:01:44,54
during the talks so that we can answer
as many of your questions as possible

31
00:01:44,54 --> 00:01:48,
there's a lot of stuff that happened as
a lot of confusion and we want to make

32
00:01:48, --> 00:01:48,99
sure that people

33
00:01:48,99 --> 00:01:53,
feel like we are actually answering
those questions and useful way

34
00:01:53, --> 00:01:56,77
and if you wanna do that would be great
and otherwise we're gonna try to have

35
00:01:56,77 --> 00:01:58,35
the second half HARDtalk be

36
00:01:58,35 --> 00:02:02,78
mostly space for questioning so but
actors Roger

37
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:07,039
okay so a lot of things have happened
over this past year and we're gonna try

38
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,71
to cover

39
00:02:07,71 --> 00:02:11,85
as many of them as we can here's a a
great quote for me either an essay or

40
00:02:11,85 --> 00:02:13,24
GCHQ I'm actually

41
00:02:13,24 --> 00:02:16,86
I'm not sure which one it is but we're
gonna start a little bit earlier in the

42
00:02:16,86 --> 00:02:18,85
process than this and work your way up
to that

43
00:02:18,85 --> 00:02:23,29
so we're in a war or rather conflict a
perception here

44
00:02:23,29 --> 00:02:27,08
there are a lot mean you saw glenn's
talk earlier there are a lot of

45
00:02:27,08 --> 00:02:30,17
large media organizations out there that
are trying to present

46
00:02:30,17 --> 00:02:35,03
tower in lots of different ways and we
all here understand the value the tour

47
00:02:35,03 --> 00:02:36,209
provides to the world

48
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,19
but there are a growing number of people
around the world who are learning about

49
00:02:39,19 --> 00:02:39,849
or

50
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,73
not from our website or from seeing one
of these talks or from learning it from

51
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:47,85
somebody who uses it and teaches them
how to use it but they read the

52
00:02:47,85 --> 00:02:50,45
time magazine or economist or whatever
the

53
00:02:50,45 --> 00:02:53,88
mainstream on newspapers are and part of
our challenges

54
00:02:53,88 --> 00:02:57,08
how do we help you and help the rest to
the world

55
00:02:57,08 --> 00:03:00,209
do outreach and education so that people
can understand

56
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,58
what source for and how it works and and
what sort of people

57
00:03:03,58 --> 00:03:07,65
actual use it so for example are GCHQ is

58
00:03:07,65 --> 00:03:10,92
I has been given instructions to try to
kill tore by

59
00:03:10,92 --> 00:03:14,85
I mean who knows maybe they thought it
on their own maybe we can imagine some

60
00:03:14,85 --> 00:03:16,81
nearby governments ask them to do it

61
00:03:16,81 --> 00:03:19,95
are and part in the challenge a they say
were

62
00:03:19,95 --> 00:03:23,8
were we have to kill it because a trial
part and it turns out that we actually

63
00:03:23,8 --> 00:03:25,03
do know that

64
00:03:25,03 --> 00:03:28,13
some people around the world are using
tor for child porn

65
00:03:28,13 --> 00:03:34,01
are for example we have talked to a lot
of federal agencies who used for

66
00:03:34,01 --> 00:03:39,23
to fetch child porn I talk to people in
the FBI who used or every day to safely

67
00:03:39,23 --> 00:03:42,54
reach the web sites that they want to
investigate I

68
00:03:42,54 --> 00:03:46,269
the most crazy example if this is
actually the internet watch foundation

69
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,22
I how many people here have heard the
internet watch foundation I see a very

70
00:03:50,22 --> 00:03:51,56
small number hands

71
00:03:51,56 --> 00:03:54,75
they are the censorship weighing above
the British government

72
00:03:54,75 --> 00:03:58,59
their the to require the government
organization who is tasked with coming

73
00:03:58,59 --> 00:04:00,88
up with the black list for the internet

74
00:04:00,88 --> 00:04:05,54
for England and we got an email from
them a few years ago

75
00:04:05,54 --> 00:04:09,079
saying know you would expect you'd
expect hey can you please shut this

76
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,59
thing down can you turn it off its

77
00:04:10,59 --> 00:04:13,709
it's a big hassle for us the question
that they asked me was

78
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,6
how can we make it or faster it turns
out that they need to our biggest

79
00:04:19,6 --> 00:04:23,28
people report URL's to them they need to
fetch them somehow it turns out that

80
00:04:23,28 --> 00:04:26,6
when you go to the URL with the
allegedly bad stuff on it

81
00:04:26,6 --> 00:04:30,039
and you're coming from the internet
watch foundation site the address

82
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,24
they give you couldn't who would have
known

83
00:04:33,24 --> 00:04:39,869
so

84
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,36
so it turns out that these sensors need
an anonymity system

85
00:04:44,36 --> 00:04:47,969
in order to censor their internet fun
times

86
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:54,129
so another challenge here

87
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,179
a at the same point one on my side
hobbies is teaching law enforcement

88
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:02,189
I how the internet works and how
security works and how to our works

89
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,839
so I mean the other job does suck but
it's actually not our fault that their

90
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,639
job sucks

91
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,219
there are a lot of different challengers
to successfully being a

92
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:14,129
a good honest law enforcement person
these days so for example

93
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,069
I went to Amsterdam and Brussels in
January this past year to try to teach

94
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,529
various law-enforcement groups

95
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,449
and i ended up having a four-hour debate
with the Dutch Regional Police

96
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,709
and then another for our debate with the
I Belgian cyber crime unit

97
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,49
and then another four hour debate with
the Dutch national police and

98
00:05:32,49 --> 00:05:35,709
there are a lot of good meaning smart
people in each of these organizations

99
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,249
but they end up

100
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:41,149
as a group doing are sometimes quite bad
thing

101
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,93
so part of our challenge is how do we
teach them that war is not the enemy

102
00:05:44,93 --> 00:05:48,779
for them and there are couple stories
that I have been

103
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,879
trying to atone refined using on them

104
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,389
I love them they always pull out the but
what about child porn what about bad

105
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,339
people what about some creep using
toward to do bad things

106
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,36
a and one of the arguments that I tried
on them was ok it's on the one hand

107
00:06:04,36 --> 00:06:07,499
we have a girl in Syria who is

108
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:11,159
alive right now because it or because
her family was able to communicate

109
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,089
safely

110
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:17,649
and the Syrian military didn't break in
and murder all of them on the other hand

111
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:21,469
we have a girl in America who is getting
hassled by some creep on the Internet

112
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:25,61
who was stalking her overt or so the
question is how do we

113
00:06:25,61 --> 00:06:29,199
how do we balance how do we value these
things do we

114
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,769
how do we sign a value to the girl in
Syria how to assign a value to the girl

115
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,449
america

116
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,119
so that we can decide which one is more
important and actually the answer is

117
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,8
you don't get to make that choice that's
not the right question to ask

118
00:06:41,8 --> 00:06:45,129
because if we take tore away from the
girl in Syria she's going to die

119
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,209
if we take tore away from the creep in
america

120
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,849
he's got a lot of other options for how
he can be a creep and starts talking

121
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:52,55
people

122
00:06:52,55 --> 00:06:56,389
so if you're a bad person for various
definitions a bad person

123
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,959
I and you're willing to break laws or go
around social norms

124
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,349
you've got a lot of other options
besides what or provides

125
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,349
whereas there are very few tools out
there like two or

126
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,579
for honest a I'm

127
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,769
I'd like to say law-abiding but let's go
with our civilization

128
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:19,769
abiding citizens out there and

129
00:07:21,23 --> 00:07:24,84
and and it's important to understand
that this hypothetical thing is actually

130
00:07:24,84 --> 00:07:28,98
also true for certain values so and art
or developer meeting that we had in

131
00:07:28,98 --> 00:07:29,5
Munich

132
00:07:29,5 --> 00:07:32,54
recently that Syrian woman came to us

133
00:07:32,54 --> 00:07:36,
and thanked us for TOR she said

134
00:07:36, --> 00:07:39,42
I'm from a city called homes you might
have heard about it it's not a city

135
00:07:39,42 --> 00:07:39,99
anymore

136
00:07:39,99 --> 00:07:44,79
I use tor my family you store we were
able to keep ourselves safe on the

137
00:07:44,79 --> 00:07:45,96
Internet thanks to tor

138
00:07:45,96 --> 00:07:49,29
so I wanted to come here to Munich to
tell you this

139
00:07:49,29 --> 00:07:52,4
thank you for the work that you're doing
and for people who

140
00:07:52,4 --> 00:07:56,03
this was their first ed meeting they
were completely blown away

141
00:07:56,03 --> 00:07:59,74
to meet this person wow the stuff that
we're working on the really actually

142
00:07:59,74 --> 00:08:03,25
really does matter they're real people
behind it and we were all

143
00:08:03,25 --> 00:08:06,81
I think very touched by it and all of us
know someone who has been on the

144
00:08:06,81 --> 00:08:07,68
receiving end

145
00:08:07,68 --> 00:08:11,79
of people being jerks on the Internet so
this is a real thing with their real

146
00:08:11,79 --> 00:08:12,7
people involved

147
00:08:12,7 --> 00:08:16,96
and its really important understand that
if you removed two option for that woman

148
00:08:16,96 --> 00:08:17,7
in Syria

149
00:08:17,7 --> 00:08:21,93
for you here in Germany now that we know
whatever Snowden has told the world

150
00:08:21,93 --> 00:08:24,94
those bad guys those jerks

151
00:08:24,94 --> 00:08:28,12
for different values about they always
have options

152
00:08:28,12 --> 00:08:32,5
but very rarely to all of us have
options to actually keep us safe

153
00:08:32,5 --> 00:08:35,979
and tour is certainly not the only one
but right now

154
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,68
and we hope in this talk we'll see that
we are making the right rate of by

155
00:08:39,68 --> 00:08:40,669
working on tor

156
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,92
one or the other child what are the
other talks that I i give to them or the

157
00:08:44,92 --> 00:08:46,32
other stories that I give to them

158
00:08:46,32 --> 00:08:50,01
are 10 the the big questions they always
ask me is

159
00:08:50,01 --> 00:08:53,05
but what about terrorists are to helping
terrorists

160
00:08:53,05 --> 00:08:56,16
and we can we can and we should talk
about

161
00:08:56,16 --> 00:08:59,11
well what do you mean by terrorists
because in China they have a very

162
00:08:59,11 --> 00:09:00,75
different definition of terrorist

163
00:09:00,75 --> 00:09:03,8
and in gaza they have a very different
definition Nov terrorist in

164
00:09:03,8 --> 00:09:07,3
I in america they're always thinking
other small number of people in some

165
00:09:07,3 --> 00:09:08,7
Middle Eastern country or

166
00:09:08,7 --> 00:09:11,89
are trying to blow up buildings or
something mom a bad guy

167
00:09:11,89 --> 00:09:15,11
i think is his name yes that a in the
NSA slides

168
00:09:15,11 --> 00:09:19,22
yes out so scenario 1

169
00:09:19,22 --> 00:09:23,23
I want to build a tool that works for
millions of people

170
00:09:23,23 --> 00:09:27,55
it will work for the next year and I can
tell you how it works so you can help me

171
00:09:27,55 --> 00:09:28,43
evaluated

172
00:09:28,43 --> 00:09:32,6
that stores problem scenario to I want
to belittle

173
00:09:32,6 --> 00:09:36,12
tool that will work for the next two
weeks it will work for twenty people

174
00:09:36,12 --> 00:09:40,07
and I'm not going to tell you about
there are so many more ways of solving

175
00:09:40,07 --> 00:09:41,3
scenario to

176
00:09:41,3 --> 00:09:45,65
than solving scenario 1: the bad guys
for all sorts of definitions a bad but

177
00:09:45,65 --> 00:09:47,83
the bad guys have a lot more options

178
00:09:47,83 --> 00:09:50,99
on how they can keep safe they don't
have to scale

179
00:09:50,99 --> 00:09:54,61
doesn't have to last forever they don't
want peer review they don't want anybody

180
00:09:54,61 --> 00:09:56,06
to even know that it's happening

181
00:09:56,06 --> 00:09:59,78
so the the challenge the door has as we
want to build something

182
00:09:59,78 --> 00:10:03,85
that works for everybody and that
everybody can analyze and learn about

183
00:10:03,85 --> 00:10:08,05
at a much harder problem they're very
they're far fewer ways of solving that

184
00:10:08,05 --> 00:10:11,92
so the terrorist ur they've got a lot of
options

185
00:10:11,92 --> 00:10:15,39
that sucks we need to build tools that
can keep the rest for the world safe

186
00:10:15,39 --> 00:10:19,77
and it's important really to try to have
some good rhetorical arguments I think

187
00:10:19,77 --> 00:10:22,89
I mean we sort of put a few fax appear

188
00:10:22,89 --> 00:10:27,52
one interesting point attention is that
people who really don't want anonymity

189
00:10:27,52 --> 00:10:32,
to exist in a practical sense maybe not
even in a theoretical human rights hands

190
00:10:32, --> 00:10:33,82
either but definitely in a practical
sense

191
00:10:33,82 --> 00:10:37,22
they're not really having honest
conversations about it for example this

192
00:10:37,22 --> 00:10:40,04
doja study the department of justice in
the United States

193
00:10:40,04 --> 00:10:43,48
they actually started to do a study
where they classify traffic moving

194
00:10:43,48 --> 00:10:44,64
toward exit nodes which

195
00:10:44,64 --> 00:10:48,55
it interesting that they were basically
probably wiretapping Exit now to do that

196
00:10:48,55 --> 00:10:49,03
study

197
00:10:49,03 --> 00:10:52,47
I wonder how they one about that but
when the last they came up with the

198
00:10:52,47 --> 00:10:55,339
number three percent of the traffic
being bad and then they aborted the

199
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,29
study because they receive many DMCA
takedown notices

200
00:10:58,29 --> 00:11:02,25
yeah apparently even a DMCA is a problem
to finding out

201
00:11:02,25 --> 00:11:06,12
answers they have a university to run
the Torres it for them and they were

202
00:11:06,12 --> 00:11:10,33
just starting out doing their study and
then the University started getting DMCA

203
00:11:10,33 --> 00:11:11,05
takedowns

204
00:11:11,05 --> 00:11:14,4
and said well we have to stop the
lawyers told us to stop

205
00:11:14,4 --> 00:11:18,29
and the Department of Justice said were
the Department of Justice

206
00:11:18,29 --> 00:11:21,339
keep doing it and then they turned it
off so

207
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,28
not sure how the balance of power goes
there but the initial results they were

208
00:11:25,28 --> 00:11:26,43
looking towards were

209
00:11:26,43 --> 00:11:29,64
about 3 percent at the traffic coming
out of that or exit node

210
00:11:29,64 --> 00:11:33,25
I was bad but I haven't figure out what
they mean by bad

211
00:11:33,25 --> 00:11:36,54
but I'll take it if it's three percent
and I think you know

212
00:11:36,54 --> 00:11:39,839
we have of course II personally don't
like to use

213
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,16
the word war when talking about the
Internet

214
00:11:43,16 --> 00:11:46,64
and I particularly dislike talking about
it when we talk about

215
00:11:46,64 --> 00:11:50,82
actual issues have terrorism and I think
that we should talk about it in terms of

216
00:11:50,82 --> 00:11:54,13
perception in conflict and one of the
most frustrating things

217
00:11:54,13 --> 00:11:58,8
is the BBC actually has articles on
their website instructing people how to

218
00:11:58,8 --> 00:12:00,68
use the so grow tent or together

219
00:12:00,68 --> 00:12:03,8
to buy drugs we are very very

220
00:12:03,8 --> 00:12:08,5
very seriously do not ever advocate that
for a bunch of reasons not the least of

221
00:12:08,5 --> 00:12:09,39
which which is

222
00:12:09,39 --> 00:12:13,24
that even a pic when is amazing its not
in anonymous currency

223
00:12:13,24 --> 00:12:16,39
and it isn't the case that these web
sites are necessarily going again but it

224
00:12:16,39 --> 00:12:17,89
will be tore I think

225
00:12:17,89 --> 00:12:21,329
there will be the weakest link but the
fact that the BBC promotes that it's

226
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,99
because they generally have a man bites
dog

227
00:12:23,99 --> 00:12:27,98
stew you could say that that's their
entire about or related

228
00:12:27,98 --> 00:12:31,53
eco-system anything that could be just
kind of a little bit interesting

229
00:12:31,53 --> 00:12:35,12
the run with it so they have something
to say about it and in this case they

230
00:12:35,12 --> 00:12:38,5
literally were promoting and pushing for
people to buy drugs

231
00:12:38,5 --> 00:12:42,07
which is crazy to me to imagine that and
that really impacts the way that people

232
00:12:42,07 --> 00:12:43,54
perceive the door

233
00:12:43,54 --> 00:12:47,18
project and the Tor network and what
we're trying to do is not that

234
00:12:47,18 --> 00:12:48,16
particular thing

235
00:12:48,16 --> 00:12:52,03
that is a sort of side effects occurs
what we want is for every person to have

236
00:12:52,03 --> 00:12:54,24
the right to speak freely and right to
read

237
00:12:54,24 --> 00:12:58,67
anonymously on the Internet and we also
need to keep in mind the different

238
00:12:58,67 --> 00:13:00,75
incentive structures that they have

239
00:13:00,75 --> 00:13:04,37
so BBC posted their first article about
Silk Road Indore

240
00:13:04,37 --> 00:13:07,91
and the comment section was packed with
oh wow thanks

241
00:13:07,91 --> 00:13:11,209
oh this is great well I don't have to go
to the street corner gunshot oh wow

242
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,44
thanks this is great

243
00:13:12,44 --> 00:13:15,66
just comment after coming to people
saying thank you for telling me about

244
00:13:15,66 --> 00:13:16,36
that

245
00:13:16,36 --> 00:13:19,78
and then a week later they posted a
follow-up article saying

246
00:13:19,78 --> 00:13:24,3
and we bought some and it was really
good

247
00:13:24,3 --> 00:13:29,24
still have what motivation are they
doing here

248
00:13:29,24 --> 00:13:32,73
and so they're they're goal in this case
is let's get more clicks doesn't matter

249
00:13:32,73 --> 00:13:36,22
what it takes. doesn't matter what we
destroy what we're doing

250
00:13:36,22 --> 00:13:39,67
for that has some serious problems
obviously because then they're

251
00:13:39,67 --> 00:13:44,01
different structures that exist to
attack as part of the war on some drugs

252
00:13:44,01 --> 00:13:48,209
and they want to show that their mission
is of course impacted by tor they want

253
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:51,26
to have an enemy that a campaign to
target on they want something sexy that

254
00:13:51,26 --> 00:13:52,62
they can get funding for

255
00:13:52,62 --> 00:13:56,26
so here's a here's a little funny a
story about an agent

256
00:13:56,26 --> 00:14:00,28
as it has in the last point to show this
massive drop and Tor network load after

257
00:14:00,28 --> 00:14:01,88
soap roadways bus is great because

258
00:14:01,88 --> 00:14:05,25
everybody realizes of course that all
the enemy traffic in the world must be

259
00:14:05,25 --> 00:14:08,4
for Alicia failed this was act at %uh
particular meeting where they were

260
00:14:08,4 --> 00:14:12,579
trying to get more funding for this is a
US government person who basically said

261
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,15
I evaluated the Tor network load at
during the Silk Road bust

262
00:14:17,15 --> 00:14:20,56
and I saw fifty percent network load
dropped when the Socceroo

263
00:14:20,56 --> 00:14:24,54
when the Silk Road bus stop so I I
started out with him arguing

264
00:14:24,54 --> 00:14:27,92
hola actually you know when there's a
huge amount of publicity about I don't

265
00:14:27,92 --> 00:14:29,209
know if door is broken

266
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,36
we can understand it would be reasonable
that some poor people would stop using

267
00:14:32,36 --> 00:14:33,65
tor for a little while

268
00:14:33,65 --> 00:14:37,04
in order to wait for more facts to come
out and then we'll be more prepared for

269
00:14:37,04 --> 00:14:37,53
it

270
00:14:37,53 --> 00:14:40,36
but then I thought you know wait a
minute we've got the tour metrics

271
00:14:40,36 --> 00:14:41,5
database we have

272
00:14:41,5 --> 00:14:44,959
all of this data I love load on the
network

273
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,67
so then I went to look let's go actually
see if there was a 50 percent drop on

274
00:14:48,67 --> 00:14:49,67
the Tor network

275
00:14:49,67 --> 00:14:52,82
so the green line here is the capacity

276
00:14:52,82 --> 00:14:56,86
above the Tor network over type so the
amount of bytes the release can push

277
00:14:56,86 --> 00:14:59,93
I've we we're loading it down completely
and the Purple Line

278
00:14:59,93 --> 00:15:04,87
is the number of bytes that are actually
handled on the network over time

279
00:15:04,87 --> 00:15:08,44
can you guess where we're if you don't
look at the day to the bottom

280
00:15:08,44 --> 00:15:11,98
can you show what that agent was talking
about

281
00:15:11,98 --> 00:15:16,02
are as the agent totally full a shit

282
00:15:16,02 --> 00:15:20,29
two-step after compression but if you
have a to anyone shouted out yeah

283
00:15:20,29 --> 00:15:23,51
you in there no

284
00:15:23,51 --> 00:15:29,43
ok but that's right it didn't go down by
fifty percent

285
00:15:29,43 --> 00:15:33,839
wow he was completely wrong but

286
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,839
just for the record that's where he said
there was a dry the

287
00:15:45,66 --> 00:15:48,8
and while we've taught you how to read
these graphs here's a graph above the

288
00:15:48,8 --> 00:15:50,56
overall network growth

289
00:15:50,56 --> 00:15:54,05
over the past three or four years so the
green line again as the amount of

290
00:15:54,05 --> 00:15:54,72
capacity

291
00:15:54,72 --> 00:15:59,23
and we've seen a bunch of people adding
fast relays recently after the Snowdon

292
00:15:59,23 --> 00:16:03,06
I issues and we'll talk a little bit
later about are what other reasons

293
00:16:03,06 --> 00:16:05,05
people are running more capacity lately

294
00:16:05,05 --> 00:16:10,709
as the load on the network goes up okay

295
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,92
and then there is the dark web or the de
Puebla

296
00:16:13,92 --> 00:16:17,279
or the whatever else the hell you call
it web and

297
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,279
again this comes back to media trying to

298
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,73
produces many articles are they can to
hear here's the basic

299
00:16:23,73 --> 00:16:27,66
I'll give you the the primer on the
stark web thing statement one

300
00:16:27,66 --> 00:16:32,54
the dark web is every web page out there
are the Google can't index

301
00:16:32,54 --> 00:16:39,54
that's the definition in the dark web so

302
00:16:40,07 --> 00:16:43,93
so every corporate database every
government

303
00:16:43,93 --> 00:16:48,09
database every everything that you
access to the web browser at work or

304
00:16:48,09 --> 00:16:48,61
whatever

305
00:16:48,61 --> 00:16:52,13
all those things a girl can get to that
is the dark web a statement what

306
00:16:52,13 --> 00:16:53,08
statement to

307
00:16:53,08 --> 00:16:56,19
ninety-something percent have web pages

308
00:16:56,19 --> 00:17:00,5
are in the dark web so these were both
well known fact a year ago

309
00:17:00,5 --> 00:17:03,72
statement 3 that the media has added
this year

310
00:17:03,72 --> 00:17:10,309
the only way to access the dark Weber is
through chore

311
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,709
these three statements together sell
more and more articles because its great

312
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,97
people. by then they're all shocked oh
my god the web is bigger than I thought

313
00:17:17,97 --> 00:17:24,97
and it's all because it or so

314
00:17:25,86 --> 00:17:29,049
really the reality of this is that it's
not

315
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,24
actually the case obviously that's a
completely laughable thing

316
00:17:32,24 --> 00:17:35,909
and for everyone that's here not
necessarily people watching on the video

317
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,48
stream but for everyone here I think

318
00:17:37,48 --> 00:17:42,32
you realize how ridiculous that is
entire setup is obviously a kind of

319
00:17:42,32 --> 00:17:46,139
click great if you would call it
something like that there are a few

320
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,47
high profile hidden services actually
just as a show of hands

321
00:17:49,47 --> 00:17:54,57
raise your hand if you run out or hidden
service right so

322
00:17:54,57 --> 00:17:58,059
no one's ever heard your turn in service
on a certain way and these are the ones

323
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:58,99
that people heard of

324
00:17:58,99 --> 00:18:02,629
and this is something which is kinda
fascinating

325
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:06,159
reality which is that these these four
sites

326
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,879
for these four entities have produced
most to the stories related

327
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:15,029
to deep gaping whatever web that you
wanna call the dark web

328
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,47
and in fact for the most part it's been

329
00:18:18,47 --> 00:18:23,889
I would say up the top one for example
with WikiLeaks it's a positive example

330
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:28,039
and in fact with global leaks which is
something that Arturo Velasco and a

331
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,919
number of other

332
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,24
really great Italian hackers here been
working on global eats

333
00:18:32,24 --> 00:18:35,45
they're deploying more and more
conservative but you also haven't heard

334
00:18:35,45 --> 00:18:37,129
about for localize corruption

335
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,86
reporting and whistleblowing but the
news doesn't report about our terrace

336
00:18:40,86 --> 00:18:41,549
great work

337
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,429
the news report on the farmers market on
freedom hosting and on

338
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,899
so gross and those things also bring out
a disproportionate amount of incredible

339
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:53,85
negative attention in the case of
freedom her saying we have a developer

340
00:18:53,85 --> 00:18:54,789
Mike Perry whose

341
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:58,12
kind of the most incredible evil genius
alive today

342
00:18:58,12 --> 00:19:01,98
i think is probably about to my period
right now if that would be my guess

343
00:19:01,98 --> 00:19:05,889
and he was relentlessly attacked

344
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,889
because he happened to have a

345
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:12,22
registration for a company which had a a

346
00:19:12,22 --> 00:19:15,389
an F in an H&amp;M wasn't

347
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,19
actually even close to what's up there
now and he was relentlessly attacked

348
00:19:19,19 --> 00:19:21,399
because the topics that the other sites
have

349
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:24,46
as part of their customer base as part
of the things that they're pushing

350
00:19:24,46 --> 00:19:25,059
online

351
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,71
be really pull on people's hearts in a
big way

352
00:19:28,71 --> 00:19:33,19
and that sort of created a lot of stress
and in the the first issue

353
00:19:33,19 --> 00:19:35,929
WikiLeaks created a lot of stress for
people working on tour in various

354
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:36,6
different ways

355
00:19:36,6 --> 00:19:41,139
but for my Perry he was personally
targeted in as sort of COINTELPRO style

356
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,75
harassment and really sad and really sad
Series events

357
00:19:44,75 --> 00:19:49,059
and of course the news also picked up on
that and some negative ways

358
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:52,25
and they're really really picked up on
that note to really be parted I think

359
00:19:52,25 --> 00:19:53,48
you could call it a kind of culture

360
00:19:53,48 --> 00:19:58,45
conflict that we're in right now the
farmers market has also quite an

361
00:19:58,45 --> 00:19:59,76
interesting story which I think

362
00:19:59,76 --> 00:20:04,929
you want to tell yet so I actually a
heard from a DEA person who was involved

363
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:05,789
in the

364
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,879
a eventual buster the farmers market
store so that a

365
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,61
long ago there was a website on the
internet and they sold drugs

366
00:20:12,61 --> 00:20:16,74
oh my god and there are people who
bought drugs from this website and they

367
00:20:16,74 --> 00:20:17,389
had no choice

368
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:20,59
tour was nowhere in the story it was
some web site in southeast asia

369
00:20:20,59 --> 00:20:24,149
on and the DEA wanted to take it down so
they

370
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:27,19
they learned I mean the website was
public to public web server

371
00:20:27,19 --> 00:20:30,919
so they sent some sort of letter to the
country that was in and the country that

372
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,34
was in said screw you

373
00:20:32,34 --> 00:20:35,95
and then they said okay well I I guess
we can't take down the web server so

374
00:20:35,95 --> 00:20:36,549
then they

375
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:40,159
are started try to investigate the the
people behind it and it turns out the

376
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:40,98
people behind it

377
00:20:40,98 --> 00:20:45,529
use touch man so they were happily
communicating with each other very

378
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,159
safely

379
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,619
are so the folks in the US are sent a
letter to Canada

380
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,919
and then Canada made house may love it
will give them the entire database UHV

381
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,98
all the emails that these people and
sent on and then

382
00:20:56,98 --> 00:21:00,25
a year or two later these people
discover tore and they're like hey we

383
00:21:00,25 --> 00:21:03,45
should switch our website overt or and
then it'll be safe that sounds good

384
00:21:03,45 --> 00:21:07,299
other DA people were watching them the
whole time looking for a good time to

385
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:07,84
bust them

386
00:21:07,84 --> 00:21:11,49
are and then this was a separate or and
then six months later was a good time to

387
00:21:11,49 --> 00:21:12,09
bust them

388
00:21:12,09 --> 00:21:16,149
I so then there are all these newspaper
articles about how to or hidden services

389
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,35
are obviously broken

390
00:21:17,35 --> 00:21:21,149
on and I the first time I heard the
story I was thinking to myself

391
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:24,47
are idiot drug sellers use Pay Pal get
busted

392
00:21:24,47 --> 00:21:29,019
and a story up but they're actually
using Pay Pal correctly they they had

393
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,46
a innocent people around the world who
are receiving people payments and

394
00:21:32,46 --> 00:21:33,809
turning it into some

395
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,7
Panama based the currency or something
so the the the better

396
00:21:37,7 --> 00:21:42,19
less another story is ideo drug sellers
use Hotmail get busted

397
00:21:42,19 --> 00:21:45,869
so there are there a lot of different
pieces have all of these don't use harsh

398
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,909
male

399
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,26
seriously to bad idea and don't use
things where

400
00:21:51,26 --> 00:21:55,269
they have habit back during their
service or cooperating

401
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,799
with so-called lawful interception
orders because it tells you that their

402
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,23
system is not secure

403
00:21:59,23 --> 00:22:02,97
and its clear that hush male falls into
that category

404
00:22:02,97 --> 00:22:07,309
big day fundamentally have chosen that
that is what they would like to do and

405
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:08,96
they should have that reputation

406
00:22:08,96 --> 00:22:12,44
and we should respect them exactly as
much as they deserve that's done use

407
00:22:12,44 --> 00:22:13,46
their service

408
00:22:13,46 --> 00:22:17,059
if you can especially if you're gonna do
this kinda stuff

409
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,169
or maybe what I mean is guys do that his
house now

410
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:25,379
but everybody else protect yourself

411
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:28,46
so the thing is that

412
00:22:28,46 --> 00:22:32,85
not every single person is actually
stupid enough to use hash map

413
00:22:32,85 --> 00:22:36,269
and so as a result we have started to
see some pretty crazy stuff happened

414
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,71
which we of course knew would happen and
we always

415
00:22:38,71 --> 00:22:43,09
understood that this would be a vector
so in this case

416
00:22:43,09 --> 00:22:47,109
this year we saw I think one of the
probably

417
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:50,6
not the most interesting exploits that
we've ever seen

418
00:22:50,6 --> 00:22:54,149
but one of the most interesting expert
who ever seen deployed against

419
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:57,33
a broad-scale users and

420
00:22:57,33 --> 00:23:01,629
we're not exactly sure who was behind it
though there was an FBI person

421
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:05,6
who went to court and Ireland and did in
fact claimed that they were behind it

422
00:23:05,6 --> 00:23:08,98
the IP space that the exploit connected
back to was

423
00:23:08,98 --> 00:23:12,73
either SAIC or NSA and I had an inner

424
00:23:12,73 --> 00:23:16,98
I had an exchange with one of the guys
behind the hoop and exploit company

425
00:23:16,98 --> 00:23:20,899
and he has on a couple occasions
mentioned writing exploits for TOR

426
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,98
browser

427
00:23:21,98 --> 00:23:25,379
and what he really means is Firefox and

428
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:28,149
this is a serious problem of course if
they want to target a person though the

429
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:30,419
first they have to actually find them

430
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,26
so traditionally if you're not using tor
to go to your house

431
00:23:34,26 --> 00:23:38,019
the plugins and year to go to the ISP
extreme negligence in here or there is

432
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,779
an interception with an MC catcher and
things like that

433
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:44,529
most abused techniques I'll talk about
on Monday with Claudio

434
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,029
I'm if you're interested am but
basically it's the same

435
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,25
they find out who you are then they
begin to tire you

436
00:23:51,25 --> 00:23:54,76
when they serve your next flight this
year one of the differences is that they

437
00:23:54,76 --> 00:23:57,59
had actually taken over it or hidden
service

438
00:23:57,59 --> 00:24:00,649
and started to serve up an exploit from
that just

439
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,809
trying to exploit every single person
and visited the hidden service so there

440
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,809
was a period of time when you could
really badly troll all your friends by

441
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,859
just putting

442
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:10,929
a link up where who would load in an
iframe and they would have been

443
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:11,779
exploited

444
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,26
if they were running an old version of
Firefox an old version of Tor browser

445
00:24:16,26 --> 00:24:19,44
which was an interesting twist they
didn't actually as far as we know

446
00:24:19,44 --> 00:24:23,309
use bad exploit against anyone well it
was a fresh

447
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,72
zero-day but they did write it and they
did serve it up

448
00:24:26,72 --> 00:24:31,82
and they gave the rest of the world the
payload to use against whoever they like

449
00:24:31,82 --> 00:24:36,529
so when the FBI did this they basically
gave an exploit against Firefox and Tor

450
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,029
browser to the Syrian

451
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:42,429
electronic army couldn't have written
one even if they wanted to

452
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,669
this is a really interesting difference
between other ways that the FBI might

453
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:46,639
try to bust you

454
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,909
where they can localize the damage love
hitting untargeted

455
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:53,909
people who are otherwise innocent
especially

456
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,109
by we've asked Firefox try to integrate
some of these probes related things that

457
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,399
we've done we'd like to be able to be
more up to speed with Firefox

458
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,74
and they generally seem friendly to it I
think that's a fair

459
00:25:04,74 --> 00:25:08,35
fair thing to say but we have the
synchronization

460
00:25:08,35 --> 00:25:11,789
but even East with that the
synchronization we were still had a

461
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,48
what they were doing as far as we can
tell but they are actually at the point

462
00:25:15,48 --> 00:25:16,149
where

463
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,419
the have hired probably some people from
this community the fuck you

464
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,919
and day writers exploits

465
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,21
answered them up and so that is a new
turn

466
00:25:28,21 --> 00:25:32,159
we have not seen that before this year
and that's a really serious change

467
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,25
as a result we've obviously been looking
into Chrome which has a very different

468
00:25:35,25 --> 00:25:38,24
architecture in some cases a
significantly harder to exploit in

469
00:25:38,24 --> 00:25:39,169
Firefox

470
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,58
even with just very straightforward but
we should be very easy to exploit the

471
00:25:42,58 --> 00:25:44,19
crown team has done a good job

472
00:25:44,19 --> 00:25:47,24
we want to have a lot of diversity in
the different browsers but we have a

473
00:25:47,24 --> 00:25:49,849
very strict set of requirements for
protecting

474
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,859
privacy what are other and there's a
whole design document up there

475
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,549
so just adding to run a web browser
together is not quite enough you need

476
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:59,679
you need some actual thoughts that have

477
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,359
been mostly by Mike parry and Aaron
Clark have been elucidated in the Tor

478
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,059
browser design document

479
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:08,07
so we are hoping to work on that if
anyone here would like to work on that

480
00:26:08,07 --> 00:26:10,76
that's really something where we really
need to help because it's

481
00:26:10,76 --> 00:26:16,24
there's really only one Mike Perry
literally and figuratively

482
00:26:16,24 --> 00:26:19,75
okay another exciting topic people have
been talking about lately

483
00:26:19,75 --> 00:26:22,789
is the diversity of funding a lot of our

484
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,399
funding comes from governments US mostly
but some other ones as well

485
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,909
because they have things that they want
us to work out so once upon a time

486
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,849
I when I was looking at fundraising and
how to get money I i would go to places

487
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:35,97
and I would say

488
00:26:35,97 --> 00:26:39,679
we've got ten things we want to work on
if you

489
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,029
want to find one of these ten you can
help us at our priorities we

490
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,2
we really want to work on %uh
circumventing censorship

491
00:26:46,2 --> 00:26:49,33
we really want to work on anonymity we
really want to work on tour browsers

492
00:26:49,33 --> 00:26:50,059
safety

493
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:54,059
so if you can if you have funding for
one at the is then we'll focus on the

494
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:54,99
one that your

495
00:26:54,99 --> 00:26:58,349
are most interested in so there's a
trade-off here up

496
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:01,51
on the one hand government funding is
good because we can do more thinks

497
00:27:01,51 --> 00:27:02,24
that's great

498
00:27:02,24 --> 00:27:05,96
the a lot of the stuff that you've seen
from tor over the past couple years

499
00:27:05,96 --> 00:27:09,58
comes from people who are paid full-time
to be able to work on tor

500
00:27:09,58 --> 00:27:12,74
and and focus on it and not have to
worry about where they're gonna pay

501
00:27:12,74 --> 00:27:13,75
their rent or

502
00:27:13,75 --> 00:27:17,25
or whether gonna get food on the other
hand it's bad because

503
00:27:17,25 --> 00:27:21,169
I funders can influence our priorities
no there's no conspiracy

504
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,549
it's not that people come to us and say
here's money do a back door and so on

505
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,159
we're never gonna put any back doors
into or

506
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,849
ever maybe you could tell the story
about an really a high-pitched lady who

507
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:35,98
tried to get you to tell you that it was
your duty and then you explained

508
00:27:35,98 --> 00:27:39,49
give me few more details

509
00:27:39,49 --> 00:27:42,909
people have approached us obviously in
order to try to get us to do these types

510
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:43,46
of things

511
00:27:43,46 --> 00:27:46,889
and this is a serious commitment that
the whole tower community

512
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:49,96
gets fired which is that we will never
ever put in a back door

513
00:27:49,96 --> 00:27:53,24
and any time that we can tell that
something has gone wrong

514
00:27:53,24 --> 00:27:56,389
we try to fix it as soon as possible
regardless

515
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,409
actually I would say for myself any
other consequences

516
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,32
that our commitment to protecting
anonymity our user base

517
00:28:03,32 --> 00:28:07,
extends beyond any reasonable commitment
actually

518
00:28:07, --> 00:28:09,919
and we really believe that commitment
and there are people that have tried to

519
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,109
get us to change that tried to tell us
that alright

520
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:16,57
only because your living in the free
world and you're able to have a company

521
00:28:16,57 --> 00:28:18,58
that and make a profit that you can even

522
00:28:18,58 --> 00:28:21,82
right to suffer so come on do your duty
and of course when we tell them where

523
00:28:21,82 --> 00:28:23,029
nonprofit

524
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,639
and that we're not gonna do it they're
completely dumbfounded for example

525
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:33,639
now I remember that discussion yes
haircut

526
00:28:34,32 --> 00:28:38,49
this was a discussion with the US
Department of Justice person

527
00:28:38,49 --> 00:28:42,26
I who basically said it's your the
congress has given

528
00:28:42,26 --> 00:28:45,49
us the Department of Justice the right
to

529
00:28:45,49 --> 00:28:48,54
backdoor everything and you

530
00:28:48,54 --> 00:28:52,84
have a tool that you haven't made it
easy for us to back door

531
00:28:52,84 --> 00:28:57,27
so it's your responsibility to fix it so
that we can use the privileges and

532
00:28:57,27 --> 00:28:58,27
rights given us

533
00:28:58,27 --> 00:29:01,419
by congress on you know surveilling
everybody

534
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,51
and you are taking advantage above the
situation that we've given you an

535
00:29:05,51 --> 00:29:06,47
America where

536
00:29:06,47 --> 00:29:09,7
you've got good freedom of speech and
you've got other freedoms and so on your

537
00:29:09,7 --> 00:29:13,26
your your stealing from the country
you're cheating on the process

538
00:29:13,26 --> 00:29:17,62
by not giving us the back door the
congress said we should have and then I

539
00:29:17,62 --> 00:29:18,99
said actually we're a nonprofit

540
00:29:18,99 --> 00:29:22,84
we work for the public good and then
then the conversation basically ended

541
00:29:22,84 --> 00:29:29,84
she had no further than a sec

542
00:29:32,55 --> 00:29:35,85
so part of what we need to do is
continue to make tools that are actually

543
00:29:35,85 --> 00:29:36,55
safe

544
00:29:36,55 --> 00:29:39,58
as tools rather than a lot of the other
systems out there

545
00:29:39,58 --> 00:29:43,62
on the other hand I'll every funder
we've talked to lately

546
00:29:43,62 --> 00:29:47,66
has interesting priorities they want to
pay for censorship resistance they are

547
00:29:47,66 --> 00:29:48,56
paper outreach

548
00:29:48,56 --> 00:29:52,04
education training and so on we don't
have any funders right now

549
00:29:52,04 --> 00:29:55,27
who want to pay for better anonymity and

550
00:29:55,27 --> 00:29:58,99
it's really important for some other
people we heard about in the last talk

551
00:29:58,99 --> 00:30:02,94
that they have really good anonymity
against really large adversaries

552
00:30:02,94 --> 00:30:06,57
and I'm not just talking about american
intelligence agencies there are a lot of

553
00:30:06,57 --> 00:30:08,42
intelligence agencies around the world

554
00:30:08,42 --> 00:30:11,69
who are trying to learn how to serve a
leveraging

555
00:30:11,69 --> 00:30:14,69
so what should

556
00:30:14,69 --> 00:30:18,56
tours role be here there are a lot of
people in the toward development

557
00:30:18,56 --> 00:30:19,7
community who say

558
00:30:19,7 --> 00:30:23,09
what we really need to do is focus on
writing good code

559
00:30:23,09 --> 00:30:26,12
and will let the rest the world to curve
itself on

560
00:30:26,12 --> 00:30:29,89
there's also a trade-off from some other
funders we have right now

561
00:30:29,89 --> 00:30:33,58
where I I could go up and I could say a
lot

562
00:30:33,58 --> 00:30:37,79
love really outrageous things that I
agree within that you agree with

563
00:30:37,79 --> 00:30:42,41
I but some other funders might wonder I
if they should keep funding us after

564
00:30:42,41 --> 00:30:42,85
that

565
00:30:42,85 --> 00:30:46,85
so part of what we need to do is get
some funders

566
00:30:46,85 --> 00:30:50,68
who are more comfortable with the
message is that everybody here

567
00:30:50,68 --> 00:30:55,06
would like the world to hear so if you
know anybody who wants to help provide

568
00:30:55,06 --> 00:31:00,46
actual freedom we'd love to hear from
you and it's important to understand the

569
00:31:00,46 --> 00:31:02,82
resort %uh havin interesting

570
00:31:02,82 --> 00:31:06,88
place in the world at the moment where
its easy to say

571
00:31:06,88 --> 00:31:10,06
that we shouldn't be political and then
general

572
00:31:10,06 --> 00:31:14,03
there shouldn't be politics and what
we're doing and it's also easy to

573
00:31:14,03 --> 00:31:15,75
understand that that's crazy

574
00:31:15,75 --> 00:31:19,14
when someone says that to an extent
because

575
00:31:19,14 --> 00:31:23,5
the idea of having free speech having
the right to read having the ability to

576
00:31:23,5 --> 00:31:23,92
reach

577
00:31:23,92 --> 00:31:29,21
a website it is beyond the power the
state that is a very political thing for

578
00:31:29,21 --> 00:31:31,8
many people and it is often the
privilege

579
00:31:31,8 --> 00:31:35,3
up some where they don't even realize
that a political statement

580
00:31:35,3 --> 00:31:38,93
and they suggest and they suggest

581
00:31:38,93 --> 00:31:42,31
that we don't need to be political we
need to recognize the political context

582
00:31:42,31 --> 00:31:45,5
that we exist and especially after the
summer snowden

583
00:31:45,5 --> 00:31:49,27
understanding that there are almost no
tools

584
00:31:49,27 --> 00:31:53,01
that can resist the NSA and GCHQ almost
none

585
00:31:53,01 --> 00:31:56,64
we did not survive completely in the
Summer Sun

586
00:31:56,64 --> 00:32:00,11
they were able to get some tore users
but they couldn't get all

587
00:32:00,11 --> 00:32:04,26
to our users that's really important we
change the economic game for them

588
00:32:04,26 --> 00:32:11,26
and that fundamentally is a political
issue

589
00:32:18,25 --> 00:32:21,69
but please note that the solution is not
a partisan solution

590
00:32:21,69 --> 00:32:26,679
where we say will some people are good
and some are bad you guys over there

591
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,99
and left her on the right you don't
deserve to have freedom

592
00:32:29,99 --> 00:32:34,09
have speech you don't have the right to
read we aren't saying that we're saying

593
00:32:34,09 --> 00:32:35,35
that the common good

594
00:32:35,35 --> 00:32:39,11
everyone having news fundamental rights
protected in a practical way

595
00:32:39,11 --> 00:32:43,25
is an important thing for us to build
one for all of us to contribute to

596
00:32:43,25 --> 00:32:43,73
efforts

597
00:32:43,73 --> 00:32:46,86
every person to have that his I think

598
00:32:46,86 --> 00:32:49,94
the best kind of political solution we
can come up with

599
00:32:49,94 --> 00:32:53,37
though it is a very controversial one in
some ways I think that

600
00:32:53,37 --> 00:32:58,169
we can to actually do it unless everyone
really starts to agree with us and we

601
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,809
are making a lot of positive change in
this as we saw with the network graph

602
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,85
but this comes from mutual aid and
solidarity

603
00:33:04,85 --> 00:33:10,82
which most the people in this room
provide and that diversity a user's

604
00:33:10,82 --> 00:33:14,
is actually technically what makes tour
say

605
00:33:14, --> 00:33:17,919
you need to have activists in various
countries

606
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,07
and fault in russia right now and

607
00:33:21,07 --> 00:33:24,44
law enforcement around the world you
need to have them all in the same

608
00:33:24,44 --> 00:33:25,07
network

609
00:33:25,07 --> 00:33:29,97
otherwise if I see that you're using tor
I can start getting why you're using tor

610
00:33:29,97 --> 00:33:33,
so we need that diversity abusers not
just

611
00:33:33, --> 00:33:37,22
up for a perception perspective but for
actual technical perspective

612
00:33:37,22 --> 00:33:40,659
we need to have all the different are
types of users out there

613
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:44,019
blending into the same system so that
they can keep each other say

614
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:47,97
so part of the the hobbies that each or
person has

615
00:33:47,97 --> 00:33:52,23
we're all are getting better at our
reach to various communities

616
00:33:52,23 --> 00:33:55,5
so I mentioned earlier that I talk to
law enforcement

617
00:33:55,5 --> 00:33:58,98
are to try to teach them how these
things work turns out that having Jake

618
00:33:58,98 --> 00:34:02,26
talk to law enforcement is not actually
the most effective way to convince the

619
00:34:02,26 --> 00:34:02,899
most things

620
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,649
so I'm I'm I'm yeah you know my lawyer

621
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:09,56
give me some great advice but I can tell
you without breaking the privilege of

622
00:34:09,56 --> 00:34:10,72
our other communications

623
00:34:10,72 --> 00:34:16,27
but she says never miss a chance to shut
the fuck up and that I think really

624
00:34:16,27 --> 00:34:20,23
really underscores why I should not talk
to police about why they also need

625
00:34:20,23 --> 00:34:23,839
traffic analysis resistance reachability
network security privacy and anonymity

626
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,419
Rogers much much more diplomatic so at
the same time we have people talking

627
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:33,869
to domestic violence and abuse groups
and teaching them how to be safe

628
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:37,629
and at the same time we have falter
corporations learning how to be safe

629
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:38,79
online we hear

630
00:34:38,79 --> 00:34:41,8
from large companies who are saying I
want to

631
00:34:41,8 --> 00:34:45,429
put the entire our corporate traffic

632
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,899
overt or because we actually do have
adversaries and they actually are spying

633
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,31
on us and they do want to learn what
we're doing so how do we become safe

634
00:34:53,31 --> 00:34:57,19
from the situation so part of what we
need is help from a love you

635
00:34:57,19 --> 00:35:00,98
to become outreach for all of your
communities and get better at teaching

636
00:35:00,98 --> 00:35:03,31
people about why privacy is important

637
00:35:03,31 --> 00:35:07,26
for the communities that you're talking
to and learn how to use their language

638
00:35:07,26 --> 00:35:11,27
and convince them that these things are
important and at the same time teach

639
00:35:11,27 --> 00:35:11,93
them about the

640
00:35:11,93 --> 00:35:16,44
other groups out there who care so they
can understand it's a bigger issue than

641
00:35:16,44 --> 00:35:17,5
just whatever their

642
00:35:17,5 --> 00:35:21,13
most focused on okay

643
00:35:21,13 --> 00:35:25,25
so a while ago I wrote up a list of
three ways to destroy it or

644
00:35:25,25 --> 00:35:29,22
I the first way which we've got a we
have a handle on it for a while the

645
00:35:29,22 --> 00:35:30,17
first way is

646
00:35:30,17 --> 00:35:34,21
change the laws for the policies are the
cultures are so that

647
00:35:34,21 --> 00:35:38,05
anonymity is outlawed and we're pretty
good at fighting back

648
00:35:38,05 --> 00:35:42,18
in government and policy in culture and
so on and saying no no there are there

649
00:35:42,18 --> 00:35:43,83
good uses these things you can't

650
00:35:43,83 --> 00:35:48,9
take them away from the world the second
way make ISP's hate hosting

651
00:35:48,9 --> 00:35:53,9
exit relates and if more and more ISPs
say no I'm not gonna do that

652
00:35:53,9 --> 00:35:57,89
then eventually the Tor network shrinks
reducing the anonymity it can provide

653
00:35:57,89 --> 00:35:59,93
because there's not as much diversity

654
00:35:59,93 --> 00:36:03,38
up where you might pop out to the Tor
network to go to the website

655
00:36:03,38 --> 00:36:06,8
so I think we're doing pretty well
fighting that fight a we've known about

656
00:36:06,8 --> 00:36:09,71
it for a while it's one we've been
focusing on for a long time

657
00:36:09,71 --> 00:36:13,02
tore servers dotnet a lot of other
groups are doing great work

658
00:36:13,02 --> 00:36:16,22
at building and maintaining
relationships with ISP's

659
00:36:16,22 --> 00:36:19,25
but the third one is one that we haven't
focused on

660
00:36:19,25 --> 00:36:22,4
as much as we should which is make
website hate

661
00:36:22,4 --> 00:36:25,63
tore users so a growing number of places

662
00:36:25,63 --> 00:36:29,119
are just refusing to hear from for use
at all

663
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,23
I Wikipedia did that a long time ago
Google gives you a captcha if you're

664
00:36:33,23 --> 00:36:34,46
lucky

665
00:36:34,46 --> 00:36:38,26
that's the best question ever feel like
that's a good setup

666
00:36:38,26 --> 00:36:41,26
I'll cover this one next have

667
00:36:41,26 --> 00:36:44,79
so Skype is another interesting example
here

668
00:36:44,79 --> 00:36:48,44
if you run it or exit relay you try to
Skype with somebody

669
00:36:48,44 --> 00:36:52,28
microsoft hangs up on you and the reason
for that is not that they say oh my god

670
00:36:52,28 --> 00:36:54,56
or people are are abusing Skype

671
00:36:54,56 --> 00:36:58,55
Microsoft pays some commercial company
out there to give them a blacklist they

672
00:36:58,55 --> 00:37:00,2
don't even know what's on it

673
00:37:00,2 --> 00:37:04,63
and the company put store exit IP's on
it and now a Microsoft black lists all

674
00:37:04,63 --> 00:37:07,29
the tower exit relays and they don't
even know they're doing it they don't

675
00:37:07,29 --> 00:37:08,14
even care

676
00:37:08,14 --> 00:37:11,19
so as more and more of these
blacklisting companies

677
00:37:11,19 --> 00:37:14,569
I exist we're more and more screwed

678
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:19,21
so we need help trying to I learn how to
teach all of these companies

679
00:37:19,21 --> 00:37:22,9
how to accept users without thinking
that IP addresses

680
00:37:22,9 --> 00:37:26,5
are the right way to identify people
there might also be

681
00:37:26,5 --> 00:37:30,81
on point three a relationship here with
some other other points here

682
00:37:30,81 --> 00:37:33,91
for example point for which is to say
that

683
00:37:33,91 --> 00:37:38,319
when a company does not want to give you
location anonymity

684
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,97
maybe there's a reason for that I mean I
personally think that Wikipedia is great

685
00:37:42,97 --> 00:37:46,41
I don't feel so great about Yelp and
about Google

686
00:37:46,41 --> 00:37:49,49
most the time and I definitely don't
feel good about Skype

687
00:37:49,49 --> 00:37:53,589
given what we've learned it makes sense
that they would demonstrate that they do

688
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,5
not respect

689
00:37:55,5 --> 00:37:59,53
you as users and the Tor network as a
way to protect users from

690
00:37:59,53 --> 00:38:02,63
them actually and to some of these

691
00:38:02,63 --> 00:38:05,67
places will say that its beauty
basically only being

692
00:38:05,67 --> 00:38:09,08
use for abuse often they won't have
metrics for it

693
00:38:09,08 --> 00:38:12,849
and they will refuse to work with us to
come up with inventive solutions

694
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,14
like for example something where you
have to use

695
00:38:16,14 --> 00:38:19,859
a a name system in some kind in the case
in Wikipedia

696
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,69
or something where you saw the capture
something where you have to have an

697
00:38:22,69 --> 00:38:24,74
account something where your suit
anonymous

698
00:38:24,74 --> 00:38:28,25
but you get to retain location privacy
and in

699
00:38:28,25 --> 00:38:31,83
actually in a few cases it's probably
better that or is blocked because

700
00:38:31,83 --> 00:38:35,349
they don't even provide secure loggins
when you're not using tor so it's not

701
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:38,099
necessarily always a good thing to use
the services anyway

702
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,5
so a net serve funny sense it could be
helpful that they're blocking tore

703
00:38:42,5 --> 00:38:47,06
but we would like to improve those
things when one thing is to show that we

704
00:38:47,06 --> 00:38:50,359
need to build some systems to get these
properties

705
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:53,49
and we need to show that it is the best
thing right now

706
00:38:53,49 --> 00:38:56,66
that we all can use and we need people
that are working

707
00:38:56,66 --> 00:38:59,92
with these companies with these
communities actually help us to

708
00:38:59,92 --> 00:39:02,
understand how we can better

709
00:39:02, --> 00:39:05,099
server at torch immunity but

710
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,55
also but or community that overlaps with
their community

711
00:39:08,55 --> 00:39:12,51
especially Wikipedia it for me
personally it kills me that the way that

712
00:39:12,51 --> 00:39:14,9
I get to edit the wiki or should I edit
it

713
00:39:14,9 --> 00:39:17,819
is that I have to send an email to
someone tell them in a county already

714
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:18,41
have

715
00:39:18,41 --> 00:39:23,51
ask them to set a special flag in the
wiki pedia database and then I can login

716
00:39:23,51 --> 00:39:27,099
and edit that's not really the ideal
solution

717
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,01
I think if I'm not being abusive on
Wikipedia I should be able to have

718
00:39:31,01 --> 00:39:34,589
soon on a mess waiter at it I should be
able to anonymously connected I should

719
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,23
be able to do that from anywhere in the
world

720
00:39:36,23 --> 00:39:39,819
especially when the local network
censored me and my only way to get

721
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:43,27
to the Wikipedia is to in fact you store

722
00:39:43,27 --> 00:39:50,27
or something like it

723
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:55,579
so the last point on that who is this
one

724
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:59,079
at what was the joke the George main
yeah so I showing is you know

725
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,779
showing mister an enemy researcher and
he started yelling I P O I P O IPOs soon

726
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:04,619
as he saw this

727
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,339
graphite or users over time so in the
course of the week or so

728
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,099
we added about four or five million to
our clients to the network

729
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:16,45
and you would think allow the stalking
thing worked it's great

730
00:40:16,45 --> 00:40:22,259
but actually some jerk in the Ukraine
signed up is $5 million node botnet

731
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:25,859
I mean one of the good things about this

732
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,95
is that we learned that the Tor network
scales to more than five million users

733
00:40:30,95 --> 00:40:37,95
we've been working out a little early
and work we had to make some changes

734
00:40:38,3 --> 00:40:41,88
there's for example the and/or
handshaking

735
00:40:41,88 --> 00:40:44,93
which is using elliptic curves that is
something which

736
00:40:44,93 --> 00:40:49,17
really helps to reduce the load on the
relays this is a up

737
00:40:49,17 --> 00:40:53,319
pretty big change but there's a lot of
work to my Perry is done load balancing

738
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:56,619
lot of work by Nick Matthews and lotsa
changes the Tor network for

739
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,79
for scalability but if this had been
like a real attacker

740
00:40:59,79 --> 00:41:02,42
to bomb it had been turned against it or
network it probably would have been

741
00:41:02,42 --> 00:41:03,03
fatal

742
00:41:03,03 --> 00:41:07,22
I think Inc really interesting details
that this was a bonnet for Windows

743
00:41:07,22 --> 00:41:11,66
and microsoft has the ability to remove
things that they flagged as malicious

744
00:41:11,66 --> 00:41:14,97
and so they were going around in
removing

745
00:41:14,97 --> 00:41:18,089
tore clients from Microsoft Windows
users

746
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:21,23
that were part of this botnet now when
we talk for them

747
00:41:21,23 --> 00:41:24,28
my understanding is that they only
removed when they were certain that it
