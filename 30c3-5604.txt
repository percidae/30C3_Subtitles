[Start is already in Amara]

And because [...] . this is what we were interested in.

if you are cia or certain parts of the military one of the things you organise logistics is to create front companies. 

This is very good idea for several reasons, because it keeps your name off of things.  It never says CIA NSA etc in the paperwork.  its a very good idea secondly because there is much more freedom of movement to civilians than military. If you want to charter a plane and go to Pakistan as a civilian, no big deal.  If you are military and you fly in, well you just started a war. ...

The problem with fake companies is that you have file the same paperwork as civilians. .... The theory was if we can identify the airplane companies are involved this program and track them we may be able to track them somehow. .... We thought, if i were a front company, what would i need to do?  Well, i would want to fly and land at every military bases around the world. We thought lets write to military bases and ask for all .... civilian air plane flights.

This is the document called CALP

You will find all kinds of certain flights and most can only land in conas.  
...
Then you find Stephen Express leasing. They can land at any ... where.  Richmore avaiateion.. these all have worldwide clearances.  Premeir Transport Services... *laughter*  anywhere there is various..
    
Premier exuctuive transport service. 
It turns out they have an address:  

[reads address from the top right of the envelope]

.....

The sign outside says Attorneys, a couple of divorce lawyers outisde of Boston.
 *laughter* 
 When I went in there to ask about Premier exuctuive transport services, they threw me out.

I kept looking. it's a public compnay. They ahave to file articles of coorperation.  ...

I was interested in the boards and stafff. ... Finding people like Coleen and James and Brian, and ..Tyler Edward Tate (my favorite) ...
ihis birthdayte is in 1950's , social is .... no electronic trail with this person. His only address is a PO at his post office outside the Washing DC airport. ....

I did a reverse records search and... hundreds of name show up *applasuse and laughter*

Going back to airplane companie, so go back to FFA and want to see all  registration numbers and serial numbers. .... I want to see the flight plans now, an then you start to get docuements that look like this.    

*gives all locations*  
....


We started tracking these routes to a single location

......

This is map drawn by a former ghost prisoner of what he thought this balck or dark prison looked like. 
.... 

We were able to find the probably location of a cia black site in Kabul and we flew out there 

and we had a hard time finding a tax driver to find the road it was on. ....

We had to find a driver who knows the roads before the soviet occupation.

0:16:30

As we go out  .....  Afghanistan, we are in traffic jam,   of goats and traditional Afghan man.  but we notice that this shepard is wearing a baseball cap and the letter KBR are on the cap. the KBR is Kellog, Brown and Route, subsidiary of Halliburton.   A company Dick Chencey was involved with.  


.... 



This is another black site in Kabul.



...

What other architecture enable this covert action, front companies.  
....
The front company are grey zone, they do real work sometimes but they also doing work for CIA 

What happen was that two of these company's got into a dispute into billing.  Sports flight airways and 
.....  
They charter flights for sports teams and the CIA.  
I'm not making this up.  The lawsuit ended up going in to the district court in NY. 
No one recognized this, including the CIA. 
...
So no one got it thrown out of courts with state secrete.  So there ended up being hundreds of documents and you find invoices for rendition flights and from *many locations*. 
....
Invoice for telephone calls that were made during in flight! They were trying to get reimbursed for satellite phone calls.

 and also dispositions.

So i started making this gian map trying to understand all this information.
Turned out that Dyncorp was behind that
and sport flight ....




I started to go around and photographing these places to see ......  

And took pictures of people like Bill Vigil that were mentioned in the documents.  
....

What this all adds up to is the everyday landscape.

We are looking at an very secret and covert operation and evil. 
.... 
It is all around it to me quite terrifying.

Other contradictions:
Places to see secrecy. You can just look up outside.  I spend a lot of time out in Nevada. Most drones are out in Nevada and there is a little air-force base called Creche air force base. 
Tou park you car and then you look up in the sky and you see what looks like a bunch of insects that are drones.
I spend a lot of time....
....

This a a video of a Drone. I'm think this is a...  It's sounds like a tai fighter.

This is the kind .....

These kinds of sky scape ares... I'm really
*applause*
When I am seeing is there a drone. I'm thinking what do they look like as far as historical images.
I also spend a lot of time looking at the night sky and what Im doing is tracking satellites and classified satellites. All the secret things in the sky.
We are on this theme of contradictions and the same  ...

They all have to obey keepers law of planetary motion and you can get something in orbit you can model its orbit.  you can predict where it will go/be.  there are a couple of astronomers and they go out with telecopies and they measure reconnaissance space craft. etc.  there are several software application where you can plug in to your sky chart and then you can try to photograph these things.  this is easier said than done

thanks to Edward Snowden this the the ....Crystal System.  That line in the middle of the image is the space craft running through the...

this is the noise and pollution bouncing off the clouds.

This is the PAN launched a few years a go.  It orbits around the earth in the same ways the earth rotates.  PAN was interesting in the same way ... i had to fly to South Africa to take this picture.. so PAn there are all kinds of because classified launch number and the military will always launch something, because they don't want the Russians to think we are launching rockets or something.

the thin iwht PAN does not have any kind of number.  some suggested that Pan stood for pick a name.  It has a rocket going off and a ?  so PAn goes up and there is a Lockheed brochure  1828 bus (?) goes into stationary orbit over ocean.  what it this? if it doesn't have a number.  so at this point I am just making up conspiracy theories.  who want to have bandwidth over indian ocean thats not NRO , nsa, or CIA etc?  why would they want to have bandwidth over the ocean?  its over kill to have dedicated satellite to t do that.  lets think about what going on here.  there are two kind of drones.  active drones and also ... drones in Yemen and Pakistan are run by cia.  the bandwidth on PAN can do 40 simultaneous drone mission
then Pan started parking itself among other communication satellites.  It burns a lot of fuel todo this and shortens the life span of the air craft. What is PAN. I don't know.

In jan 2009 (?)  my friend in Africa said USA 2002 (craft)  you should go see it. USA 202 is this thing in the bright light in this photograph.  It is the most expensive aircraft .  it has an antennae the size of a foot ball field.  No, you aren't paying attention.  did you see what it is next too?  go look it.  This little line here is called Three 2 , what it does it do? it  is the satellite communications for the middle east. It's just right there. 

*laughter*

I have fun with this photograph. so here is one of me photographing Yosemite, .....

Secret societies are always fascinated with symbols.  
Well, the same turns out to be true with the military and intelligence community.
There are all these black patches and they makes uniform patches for the intelligence communities.  why are you making uniform patches  for black projects?  well it would look weird *laughter*

Like this squadron patch  made for secret air squadron... (explains patch on slide - staff, lightning bolt, sigma, etc.)  bolt symbolized electronic warfare are.. the 5 stars and the one star and that is the famous 51 base.  As we look at these logicistics.
......

If you are going to fly secret airplanes you need to refuel them and if you do that you need a secret tanker squadron to refuel the airplanes (shows secret tanker squd patch )  *laughter*

here at the bottom ....  NKAWTG (no one kicks ass without tanker gas) ...nobody




. This stuff blew my mind when I found out about it.  All of these secret service have football games and they each have teams that fly against each other.  The football teams, the red hats (the more is less, a bear climbing over the world with a red hat,)  This patch squad flies a small squadron flying Russian migs over .....  This BHAS symbol is blue hats aint shit.  Thats what that name

Rapid capability office patch:  These guys are in charge of the x37 plane.  The airplane has there only resusable vehicle.  Heres a picture of it in the sky.  This secret has this patch.

Doing Gods work with other peoples money is the slogan for this patch.
This patch is an older for ONX and the orbital inclination on this patch are accurate.  so you can find out where they are and it says ...   We own the night .  I publish this stuff

thee was a memo that I mentioned please stop putting operational details in the patches.
so then the NRO had to start making patches like this... NROL 39

Let them hate so long as they fear - another slogan on patch
*laughter and applause*

dont ask, none of your fucking business - this slogan for this patch.

so to go back to the original contradictory proposition
you cant make invisible factories, documents, paperwork etc.
they have material imprint on the world surface.
there are a lot secret areas in the desert that the buffer zones are miles so you can see them.with your eyes.  I started looking for tools for astronomy and photography so I can try to see these things.  I asked if I could take a pcitre of jupiter, and tried to take it in the desert?  so you start to see a different landscape *applause* shows picture of landscape.

the big data center in Utah - pic
Timberline in VA - eavesdropping station 
In Nevada, this was taken about 18 miles away, when you photograph these things from the heat and haze, these things break down. 

In an image like this you are seeing two things. you are seeing a classified military base and also when you have pushed the vision so far it starts to fall apart. At 60 miles is looks like this and ...

And to condue, a couple of thoughts, the world is constantly changing and my job as an artist is to see how its constantly changing.  Earlier today Travis Godspeed mentioned that a coup of guys were pulling links from Drone strikes around the world from open channels.  One of the themes is this clock.  

Within the visible world, i think that images are fundamentally changing until now. they functioned as representation of something in the world.  if we haven't reached it yet, the vast majority of the images in the world will be made by machines for other machines an humans will never see them..  

I'll leave you with a final note which a lot of people ask is, do i get hassled by law enforcement and agencies. ?  I don't like talking about that because I think that these are civic institutions.  I don't think the guy that made patches get to win. I dont think we should get to .. let us be in fear of them.  I make fun and laugh about them if  we do...


Question from internet?  – There are two ones:
Do you know anything about underground don't?
A: Sure. There are underground bases. the blue cube and nsa and if you are talking about underground basses in .. i don't think there are any underground bases that we don't know about.  the logistics.


we are out of time
Trevor will be in the .. bar. if you would like some questions to ask. 
*applause*
