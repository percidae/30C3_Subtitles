So, my talk is going to be about Anonymity and Privacy in Public.

First I would like to start with a disclamer.
This is of course parody. Please don't throw any stones.
*laugther*

And of course I'm [...] also wearing not an burka.

This is a tin foil burka. You might be familiar with the concept of tin foil hats.

[...]
... no privacy at all.

This is actually a parody on the tin foil hat.
And we decided, I decided to wear a nicap not a burka because this is kind of an inversion of an censor bar.

To cite Oscar Wilde: "Man is least ..."

[...]

On the Internet nobody knows that I'm a dog.

Now people on the Internet do know that I'm a dog.
