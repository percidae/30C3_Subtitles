The follwoing is NOT the "baseband exploitation in 2013" presentation --

GNU name system in Saal  6 

[starting about half way through]

[showing IBF extract slide]

Lets see how we can reconstruct this for .. (audio is poor and low)

ONe thing that is missing is we have no idea how large the IBF should actually be.
We estimate the systamitc difference for the different sets.
We can use IBF for that
you can estimate the difference especially when it is very small
Basica idea is for {} you sample your set by looking at the hash, ....

NOw that we have created the data structure and extrract the [] filter, then we can try to code them. the first one will probably work and then...

the next one succeed two and we get more elements because we have more elements. lets say the next one fails and we do not know how many elements we have.
we can do a realtion with this filter and this filter. in one layer there will be half of th eleemtns.
so lets look at this, here we have 3 for7 so 10 elements and the [] filters did not decode because .....
this one will contain twice as much and multiply by 4 then .... 
we can use our IBF

so you can see that a tiny problem like revocation creates a bigger problem.
now back to the gnu name system. there is also a global identifyiers. 

It only hs to be unique within her (alice, krista) network, not globally.

If I want to change by server mapping and I would like the users to get to the new records.  But I dont want the DHT to be down.  We can put shadow records in.  Set the expiration dates so that the validity dates concur.  A little trick to make this caching work.  So everyone can get an update.

Practical concerns.
[slide]
If you trust the registrar you can be assured it will always keep your keys. 

Many paths can lead to the same user in the same zone.
After this import we can resolve Bob.
We have these issues like virtual hosting and ssl.  These existing protocols ....

The certificate says ...org and not ... gnu, so client side proxy fakes out the browser and makes it happy.  ...

When you go vcalidate against the ca system if it says gnu.org then it is ok.  As opposed to gnu....  


You are trusting on loop back here, basically doing yourself a MITM here as long as your machine is safe.
We can validate against  ...   {speaker very fast}
The proxy does not work as well as we'd like it to.  

Relative names
so we have this notion that we can put in other names, c name records we could put one thing and other in ..   i can put in .class at the end is the name of the rocrd you have resolved it from.  It would be nice if browsers could support htose kind of links.

We gns to dns, vpn to peer to peer target, we have phone reords for conversation... {short version of this }  

please come to other assemblies in thenext coulple of days and have more fun with secure networking.
a soft proxy you can plug into,  send all dns  traffic to us so we can mess with it.  of course you can use your c tool and ....
we changed crypto in 0.10, ...

for all our record types we have ()  .. for all of them we want a pg key party so you can exchange them and create your private keys and exchange  private business card demon with your business card and get pdfs for printing


question:  what about (collision detection) key look up with short keys
a:  what kind of collision?
question; in the DHT or something
the dht is collition are hashed 512.  it is more likely you will be hit by lightning

question:  setting up a boom filter?
a:  you can do it once a head of time, local pc, you dont have to do this on the network. how much network traffic do i have?  
question: so circular slide with mutliple ipvs inside , is this in sid eyour system or computer when you meet other
the , totally static, they have to compute larger one, if the () fail , this data structure is totally static

question:  with the dynmaic dns, if you have chaning ip address, how fast can you propage this?
a: how good is the dht? you might have downtime for a few hours but i wouldnt want to host ip addresses in there. i woud want social application and .... it is a performance issue but not a secfurity issue.

question:  what is the use caes?  i can see alot of use case for geeks but for commercial application and large scale do you think there is a ..?
a:  net conversation, i want to call you, call gnu. i dont want a company managing names,. i want to call you and you buddy and then we are secure in social room. these kind of are ...
jpeople dont want to do the dns because they dont want to pay the (fees) but this way you can converse

you provide authenticity and  ()  but what about robustedness, maybe by flooding with messaging wrong and corrupt hash tables etc.

a:  if the dht is attacked; you cant give us invalid records, you can ddos us, most systems unless big cannot fix but we try to route around misbehavers in the dht.  if you read ... evans.. or paper (audio out)  it has measurments and experiments in detail.

q:  if relocation lists grow to big is there aplan for versioning of list?
a:  there was a plan , if i talk to this peer recently, i can skip the thousands that are not relative; i dont see it being necessary for quite sometime.  i dont have that many revocations to worry about. maybe there should be.  only recovations should be used by high profile users that got hit badly.  if you were jacob applebaum and need to recoke your key ...  ()

q: could you limit the lifetime of everything in the dht?
a:  (audio out)      

connection dropped


q; how can i improve the technique i described
a: i dont know a better way or i would have done it.  
q; would it be possible to get the corporation of browser to add support
a:  we have been talking to tor browser bundle but i dont think its likely we will soon
