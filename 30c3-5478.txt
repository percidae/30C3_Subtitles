this is chris whos going to talk about a really hot issue so please welcome him 

here we go.
lets see.
sorry I'm using win within linux
thank you all for coming
Im chris sog..
I'm a techn and work for a bunch of  lawyers who sue the gvernment for and its a  fun job

we were the first ones to sue less than a week after snowdens first revelations

this is a histor lesson

I'll explain how the us gvmnt is adapting to changes in the tech 
and the final embrace of some secirty techs

louis free testified several times complaingin about crypto tech
for some period of time cryto wa regulated under export control
you could not export strong crypto
strong crypto fro americans, and sthitty for everyone else

fbi and friends also pushed for escrow that would let the gvnt get info about cyptu used bu cutizens

the use of robust non key .

reads slide.

the way free peictured it crypto was the devils tech
policymakers took note it was scrary techonolog
the govermnet would be blind and unable to go after the worst of the worst

the only answer is socially respoinsible encryptoion products


socially respoonsible was in the fbis mind crypt taht did not kkep your info secret

this is the clipper chip
the ideas was a 3rd party had a copyu of your private keys and the gvmn could opbtain the keys

the fbis dreams of a world of escrowed crypto did not materialize

the export controls where lessend
clinton go the ball rolling
we got to see a sane export control policy

pgp could export pretty good privacy
this ahppened in 1996
it's 20 years since and doomsdayhas not happended
we haven't seen wiretaps and other

why didn't the bad guys use encryptions
anyone can download crypto software and encrypt everything they've been dooing


pgp has not been a problem for FBI 
the problem i s not political, its a technical one

it's a usuability study of pgp

this is what pgp looked like in 1998
and it ahsnt really change that much since

really horrific situations, 
people thought ethey were encrypting but not 
sending private keys instead of public keys
this is a failure of the enfineering commnt

we do not produce easy to use tools

glenn greenwal d failed to use
snowden made a howto video and hlepd glenn out

glenns skills are probabl average but tools are really difficoult to use

this has benitted the fbi

the fact you have to downloafd something. means most people will not use it

as long as people use defaults the fbi wins when the defaults are not secure

neigher ahs ben https
they have not been https

this is a gchq slide from 2009
why is gchq interest in thttp
nearly everything a user does iused http

everything was on the internet in clear text

ssl was available but consumers don't choos ssl or not
that is made by the server
especially if server does not uspport

the gvmnt could engage in massive passive surveillance

we are now in 2013 and a lot ahs changed in the last hears and months

google first mafjor non fincancial company. rolled out ssl

so we have gone from unencrypted to a world with some communications in encrypted form

even yahoo has announcde commitment to protect information

some of this has been a result of reporting by the washing ton post.

not only users - site communications was intercepted, but internal links of these companies.

so yahoo finally got with the program and announced they started encrypting all their links

the eff report, .
a sea of green
finally moving tin the right direction
it will frustrate passive net surveillance
but https does not prevent the government

so typicially they'd like to go to backbone providers.
level3, at&t and verizon have asssted the US government

they rather go ther and get info in buldk and do keyword searchs when they get everything at once.
rather than going to tech comapnies and asking for info

this is a shift in how they obtain info on users.
they must now go to silicon valley rather than frieendly telco companie.s

a development in the relationshitp between . and .

these programs have provides acces to gvmnt long before prism.

how are these info request procesed

google will respond to lawful request form DOJ, law enforcement

what use of transport crytpo has done is move the point of interception, and 
the companies want to be the ones to provide info
they want to receve the court order,
they do not want some other company providing data about their customers

it's important to understand and take note htat the tech companies have your unencrypted data

and tahts' not going to change
it's unlikely they will protect your info so they can't hand it over to the gvmnt

vint is no a senior exec at google
vint was on a panel with me and we discused
and he said. 

read slide

I have to give vint respect for being this open and transparent
 but google cannot deliver a service unable to hand data to gvmnt without a shif tin business model
 to move to a model where the know nothig, they must give up their ad revenue
 
 and it's not clear they want to move that way
 
 googles business model does not permit them to have only encrypted data
 
 and it's not clear if they want to move 
 it seems they're ok with individualized surveillance
 
if you listen to teh statement of exec 
8 biggest tech companies publiesh clall to reforvm governmetn surveillance.

call for refor of practieces and laws.
[reads slide]

we should be happy these companies have come to our aid and 
they dont like dragnet surveillance 
but are comfortable with individualized users
i dunno maybe you are comfortable with
i do not want it turned over in any circumstance

it's fine they can chose to target which model the y want to pusruse
they are not ready to lock the gvmnt out

in 2010 Eric was interviewd about .
why google keeeps data about users.
[reads slide]
so this is not a most ar
he justified their data retention since it could be useful to the authorites

if you don't want the provider to keep your data google may not be the provider for you

they been concerned about easy to use of tools
we get some form delivered to users limiting governemts ability to bulk surveillance

FBI has a term for this, Going Dark

this is Valery ..
she's now a federal judge in NY.
she went to complain about the going dark problem
[reads slide]

what's shes saying is they can get and order to tap a phone, instant comms, maybe the person is using encrypted
but she says they get the order, but cannot do the task
the solution proposed was legal backdoors.
wanted to forece tech companies to implement lawful interception interfaces

we have CALEA 
and they wanted to expand that to google, facebook and microsoft
in may the FBI had a proposal ready to go
which would give FBI ability to fine tech companies if they did not provide access
something happend which messed up their plans.
this guy reached out
and proopsals making it easier for wiretappes is dead in the water
but it won't stay hway for ever

they will come back and say we need more powers.
many of you have heard fo the NSA 

we learned of RSA role to siwthc to a problematic covert 

the NSA needs are different from law enforcemet
NSA does not end
..
 up in court papers,
any secret backdoor will end up in 

they need backdoors that are not secret
through legistlation
we ill see governemtn officitals trying to provide powers to act in the same way like NSA

the NSA may have tools but does not mean loacl police or FBI has those toosl

the nsa might hack everyones computer but that does not mean the police does

we will see a call for local police to see the same acces that police already enjoys

companies provideing some assitsance but not all

the response have also been to use hacking tools

they've led our communit 
the two biggest playes in commercial malware

a german company called finfisher and italian called hacking tim


i will show you marting mucnk of finfisher
is he a player in the 
he create backtrack

he was profiled by bloomberg
his laptop
he has a sticker over his webcam
he knows what his products can do
it has been sold

this is a marketing from italian company
defeat encryption
total target control
thousands of encrypted comms every day
a soltuoin to the problem of encryption 

I am not personanly a huge fan

the reason government is rushing to buy is they worry about not begin able

they opened a us office in ananpolis
they have spoken on larges surveillance tradeshows
teh wiretappes ball
they spoke on 
the assoc of [read slide]

they're on apanel and sponsored a coffee break in the adfternoo

i cannot say they have sold to the local police
their market will be local and state law enforcement

if they haven't sold it's not because theyre not trying

what about the feds
the software gamma and ht makes
that doesnt work for FBI
they want custom , unique

the will pay apremium
while local will buy off the shelf hacking software
I spent a year truing to figure out what they've been doing

most research through linked in
they have a team called remote operations unit
and i searched linked in and found contractors who have worked their
i gave this to WSJ. and this isn't  really a secret 
FBI has sort of admitted they're doing this
[read slide]
she didn't say hacking, malware, webcam but this is what she talked about

they would use malware for targets they coould not reach
the WSJ was able to pin the fbi down, and the fbi can remotely activate microphones an webacams in phones an computers.

[readsslide]

i think this is terrifying, 
that LE has known the webcam lighs are not l reliable
it's scary that we have slipped into a world were the government is hacking with no informed debate or excplicit legistlation
its the authooity to search your card or home they use to hack into your laptop

the FBI does not like to use these tools on hackers they fear they could be discovered

the sad thing is this is happening
mainly contractors providing the tech and FBI agents surpervising them

we should have an informed public debate.
our elected politichians should go on the record
no one accountable has embracesd this, it's happened behind closed doores

g..

we have the aquisition of hacking and by law enforecment
the US govermnet will not rest 
they want all email, phonecall
they will seek additional authority

there are some services devlivering end-to end encryptoion

hese are seen as a massive and significant threat to ability to intercept comms

skype has advertised their encryptions
they hired independet

we have build end to end encryption
many people were surprise when we learned NSA and FBI had been able to gain acces.

skyp wasn't perfect

it wass closed soruce 
even if there was an audit it had changed over the years.
it's surprising hey adverties it's rprivate, but 

brad smith released a public statement.

[reads slide]

we assume all calls or fixed or mobile phone will offer similar levels of privacy and security
I think this is brads way to expect nothing from skype
[applause]
microsoft paid a lot of money for skyep
has huge number of users
it's now embedded in other MS products
it should be troublig that a top exec has said don't rely on us from security
to keep you safe from the government

but MS is not the only game in town
silent circle is one of thes companile
sthey are one of a handful companies trying to deliver end to end encryption
they have said they would shut down rather than building in a backdoor

we have create a [read slide]
they don't want to know what ytou're doing
they do not want to be in the business of  receiving gvmnt request.
i'm delighted these companies exists
these are the kind of companies govenment are not too happy about

adar levinson learned the hard way that companies like his are seen as a threat to the government
[read slide]

this is the first we kno of this kind of order.
this is a new world
its one thing for the gmv


its another thing entirely to say give us you encryption keys used to protect your users information
we are only going to look at one user once we have scanned everyones.
ultimately they destroyed the ke
they handed over the key and shut down the company

so this is valery chrony?
[reads slides]

so again its funny but this is the top fbi lawyer 

say what yo uwant on your website but we want your customers data.

they will demand whatever it takes.
this is a scary world and we have to adapt to

the government has sudo over any comapny
we have to resist this level of power

we as engineers must design ahead of time to withstand this kind of coercion

there are products that could withstand this level
do we turst this piece of software or technology

many have gives the appstores the power to push apps without your control

you can try this, 
google can push code down to your phone
what happens when FBI or NSA goes to google and says to push code down to your phone

to close this isn't all bad news. mostly bad news but not all
we need to take these governments seriously
the want to get our data 

we have quite a bit of people leaving
no qa sesions
