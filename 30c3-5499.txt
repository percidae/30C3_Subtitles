Alright, I'll think we're about to get started. Please take a seat and make sure the usual announcements: nothing blocking the aisles, no cables no bags nothing else so nobody trips over and we can actually empty the room if we have to in an emergency.
With that I would like to introduce Ilja, he's the director of Penetration Testing at IOActive Most of you probably know him. He's been looking at the X.org code, the X Window system code and the things he found there. I'm sure it's gonna be pretty interesting ??? before. Please give him a warm welcome.and let's hear what he has to say about it.

Thank you. So my talk is gonna be about X security and the subtitle is "it's worse than it looks" - pun intended. So I am... as Dave just introduced, I work for IOActive, I'm the director of Penetration Testing, I run Pentest, lead Pentest and to Code reviews and basically break stuff for fun and profit.
In short, my talk is gonne be, I'm gonna do a small intro, I''m gonna talk about security of X clients, ''m gonna talk about security of X servers, and then I'll have a sort of slide at the end where I'll sort of be like "How bat is it really and is there anything we can do about it?".
