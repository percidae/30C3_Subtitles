Welcome to the Subtitles Pad, nice to see you here! 
  
This pad text gets synchronized while typing, so that every person looking at this page will see the same text in realtime. This enables you to collaborate on the transcription of the spoken words! 
 
 It is also possible to change the main writer during the talk when fingers become tired.
  
Please recrute as many participants as you can. That way, we will create the best possible draft together which is later on used for setting the subtitles.
  
Thank you very, very much for your help!

Willkommen auf dem Untertitel-Pad, schön dich hier zu sehen! 
  
Dieses Pad synchronisiert sich sofort, wenn du etwas tippst. Jeder, der diese Seite ansieht, sieht den gleichen Text wie du. Auf diesem Weg kann nahtlos aus dem gesprochenen Wort eines Vortrags geschriebene Sprache werden. 
  
Der Haupt-Mitschreiber kann so während des Vortrages ganz einfach abgelöst werden, wenn z.B. die Finger müde und die richtigen Tasten nicht mehr getroffen werden.
  
Bitte versuche so viele Mitschreiber oder Kontrolleure wie möglich zu finden, um einen möglichst guten ersten Entwurf für das spätere Untertiteln zu erstellen. 
  
Vielen, vielen Dank für deine Mithilfe!

Here, the subtitles for talk XY are supposed to be created 
  
Link and further information can be found here: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Projects

The language is supposed to be: 
[ ] German 
[X ] English

use a safe language, not c
mitigations: aslr: dep, stack canaries

memory debugging tools for c:
- valgrind : link debug version of your program to valgrind.
- most recent versions of gcc and llvm ship with memory sanitizer
- SAFEcode
- ccured
- safeG
- cyclone

in the old days, you would...

these days, you have a read vulnerability. cards of memory etc.
circumvent aslr by reading the correct place
use heap spraying; javascript creates gazillions of copies all over memory

EIP
making the stack not-executable seemed to be a solution until 'return oriented programming' : 
   jumping to your own space ->  
chaining stack frames in the buffer you write ->
jump to that small place which should be executable anyway

so, stack canaries
unfortunately, solution for that is also not 100% safe
example on a cisco: echo request which says its 500 bytes long but its smaller

linux would choose magic value of zero as a stack canary
glibc does it wrong: dietlibc does it right :)


how to detect buffer overflows:
1) object based approach
    for every address in your address space, you know whether it is valid or not (valgrind keeps a shadow memory for this)
    but then, you don't detect everything (example with variable as array index here)
2) pointer based approach (ccure for example)
    pointer represented by pointer value, base, bound ('fat pointer' because of pointer arithmetic in c)  

meet SoftBoundCETS (there also was a hardbound project once)

softbound=spatial safetiy
cets = compiler enhanced temporary safety
uses disjoint fat pointers.
university of pennsylvania

valgrind makes program 20% slower, but you can't ship it like that
To remove compatibility problems with fat pointer: use shadow memory to keep fat pointer information.

advantages: source compatibility is kept. everything covered in memory, supports separate compilations (libs), low overhead.
makes your code half as fast as it used to be. 
but people also use ruby :)

void check(ptr,base,bound,size) {
  if ((ptr<base)||(ptr+size>bound)||(ptr+size<ptr)) { abort(); 

}
}
The above is wrong, you should be laughing now

ptr=malloc(size);
ptr_base = ptr;
ptr_bound = ptr+size;
if(ptr==NULL) ptr_bound = NULL;

newptr=ptr+index; // or &ptr[index]
newptr_base=ptr_base;
newptr_bound=ptr_bound;

struct { .. int num .. } *n;
..
p= &(n->arr[2]);
p_base=max(..)

but from here, it gets interesting.

int** ptr;
int*  new_ptr;

check(ptr, ptr_base, ptr_bound, sizeof(*ptr)) {

newptr = *ptr;
newptr_base  = table_lookup(ptr)->base;
newptr_bound = table_lookup(ptr)->bound;

storing metadata;

(*ptr) = new_ptr;
table_lookup(ptr)->base  = newptr_base;
table_lookup(ptr)->bound = newptr_bound;

You can do the stuff above with a hashtable, but that is expensive. Shadow space? Heap?


Loose Ends...
- global variables
- separate compilation and library code
- memcpy()
- function pointers
- createing pointers form integers
if you cast an integer to a pointer, compiler complains.
XOR to pointers could generate a doubly linked list with only 1 pointer field; these tricks don't work
- arbitrary cast and unions need to be treated right
- ..

Temporal allocation
passing fat pointers around
ptr = malloc(size)
lock : address in memory
lock : address in memory
memory that holds the lock is reset to zero

chck:
if (ptr_key != *ptr_lock_addr)
{ abort(); }
   apparently i didn't call free on that pointer yet.

value = *ptr;

I made a few contributions myself:

- introduced two function attributes to control instrumentation process
- ported softboundcets to freebsd
- instrumented freebsd libc and executable startup code
- deleted ton of now useless wrappers.
Goal: build all of freebsd world with safe memory access. Proof-of-Concept of this succeeded!

There actually were some ifdefs for Linux: did the user enable optimization or not?
